hello s welcome to Gat Plus thank you first of all I'm very interested in this poster behind you which says not a sandeep reddy vanga film but the sandeep reddy vanga film actually I'll is
that a mistake or no it's a mistake actually the film school you know we uh we always uh heard a professor saying
that you know guys you know you should make the film you should not make a film because so it's it's actually the film
by announcement video and it caught attention and it got a lot of thing and
uh poster designer Anil Banu they felt like let's use this but I F like I'm not
the Himalayas or I'm the state uh let's not use it then I corrected it and
nobody found I mean only you are asking me so I felt
like it's a statement saying the film by you know I I always felt you give 3 years four years for a film so so better
make it yeah it kind of this one so was this the film that was first called devil no that's a different thing that's
a that's a little different characterization that I told to M sir so that's that's a different film that's
that's a different story okay maybe the characterization you might find little uh you know similar but it's a different
story yeah okay so you first started this with a five minute pitch to run be
yeah 10 minutes yeah okay 10 minutes roughly at that point yeah what was the story at that point I had the Beats I I
said uh this is a story about a father and son predominantly it's a love story and This Is The Love Story between
Father and Son yeah this is the madness and this is the milu and this is the you know A to Z so I just mentioned very
like a topography the film runs in Delhi like that you know so you not you'll not
know about the villain at all for a very long time usually what happens is like in the interv will you open the villain
but this is treated this way I majorly spoke about the treatment of the film right so he was pretty impressed I was
like I was in doubt so because uh I was not prepared but I had to meet so that
you know you know that you working with him right so he he said like uh I like the energy of this story I said like
take and after 78 months I met and I narrated the entire I think and it it's 3 three and a half hours right so you
envisioned this as a father son story yes yes yes right but in the same thing
at what point did the point that the sun is an animal
yeah a almost Psychopathic creature when did that flavor come into the sun father son uh stories there so many stories we
always have this tendency of thinking what's in the market already so I thought you know see I can't give ran
sing balir as a character name it becomes like again Arjun RI Kabir another Singh so I didn't want to sound
like that because it's a lengthy name so I thought like it has to be short it has to be very powerful so I don't know when
it happened but somehow I felt suddenly it stried and I called rir and I said what do you think the title animal so he
loved it luckily when we went to register the title nobody has it nobody has it yeah no so at what point was did
you see the begin to see the Sun as this kind of a of an animal like at what
point was that was that right from the beginning or as you started writing the thing did you see okay it'll be
interesting to make this sun like so almost like a psychopath when whenever I get an idea about a story majorly every
time I have the beginning middle and end so when you know what is your end so
you'll root up to it you'll you'll build up to it so in a way I know because I wanted I want I I don't know somehow I I
like the idea of keeping the knife in Father's hand right they say look what I've done for you and if you see the
kind of expression he gives R he's like Pap did you did you gauge what is happening between me and you at least
now is a kind of a thing when I had that in my mind I felt like this is AP thing
it didn't it didn't germinate in between but I thought it it came very instinctively in the beginning itself because because in the speech also he
says like you know in your films let's say two films
basically Arjun d/ Kabir Singh and animal you first Define these flawed men
as to what the flaw is so in Kabir Singh arjin you say this this man has a
serious anger management issue an animal you kind of basically
makeal I forget the exact same same thing something like that you know so pretty much establish what is wrong with
the character and then you take that story onwards why do you feel the need to have that little definition up up
front uh it it it is very uh I I didn't even my brother was saying that do you
notice that you're following a pattern I don't know I mean it I don't know it's
it's very it's I can't really instinctive it's very instinctive and it went with a flow and uh I don't know
there is no there's no I can't dissect it right but uh I have to be very
conscious that that should not come and yeah even in the even in the Arjun also
you know the dean is saying things about him and he wants him to say sorry and like I'm not going to say sorry even he
he's saying that I don't know yeah what draws you to these very
very flawed men because for the longest time the hero was somebody who does good
things who does no wrong first there was the good hero yeah then you got amitab face where the hero was like a vigilante
killer he could do all kinds of bad things he could like want to destroy his father uh he could want to do all kinds
of things like you know you think you did not usually see a hero do and then we went into this love story phase in
Hindi where again Heroes became good again and then now we're seeing a little bit of this so what draws you to this
flawed hero uh you were attracted to that because um what I figured out even
this this question I asked myself also what I figured out from the childhood
whatever films I liked were all flawed man I don't know for some reason can can
you name a couple of films that you like IND Chu Kam shatru is not a flawed man Wes character he's a little angry young
man there's a lot actually in Hindi to there's a lot of films right and majorly this this happened very in a very slow
ascending order but I went into film school you know exposed to World Cinema
it became much bigger but David Fincher Martin scy films watching them Stanley
cubric films so it it it I felt like okay Zone you can tell a story in this
Zone The Confidence came from those World Cinema where I felt like okay fla mena you can tell the story in a very
compelling way then audience will sit through so yeah in animal the nice thing
is or the the interesting thing is even the father becomes a flawed man he's a flawed man as well yeah he's not perfect
either it's not like this guy's rebelling and see for example in Arjun the father's a good guy like like
arjun's the rebel whatever he's got the he's the real up guy but the father is like a good guy but here the
father is also like like he's sted up in his own way you know the accomplishment is so high so it can't there there's no
balance there's no balance yeah yeah yeah so so what pushes you to write in these extremes I think that's what
that's a whole drama that's a drama you get the drama only when when you deal with extreme things or else see imagine
like father was like B father or somebody else other kind of father this this will not be like that you know and
uh even uh even when the mothers is talking to him he says like children need love and attention Balby and the
way he sheds her that shows that you know like he doesn't want to get into that topic because he knew that he's at
fault so yeah yeah so what is uh the way you saw it what is Ran's Arc in the film
uh I'll tell you what I saw let let me know if this is how you saw it in a childhood he's desperate for his
father's love then uh he doesn't get what he wants so so that leads him to
certain uh disturbing behaviors so then father sends him to boarding school
which is like a cage you cage the animal in a in a boarding school and then in America and he comes back as a kind of a
tamed man but when the father is shot and he realizes that the brother-in-law
is is responsible the animal in him bursts out again is that kind of roughly
yeah the thing is like when you when see I felt always that when when you have
that kind of a connection with the parents you know when you are not in touch also there's always that pain you're carrying throughout right that
you know I'm not talking to my father from so long and he's not trying to call him so in a situation like that when you
know that somebody's trying to kill your father I think your emotion doubles and
multiplies I even the anger even the love even the fear of losing becomes much more bigger I think that's where
like this I mean I didn't try to justify also right because in in the edit room
when I was watching from A to Z like not a continuous flow but when in bits and pieces I used to get this
feeling that what has happened with these guys last you know because ranir played it so
well I have no words to express R Beach is an extraordinary performance yeah even I felt that in Sanju and even
rockstar I lost in while I was watching I lost that that it's a cinema
especially it happened only with Sanju for me I forgot that it was a film and it happened with anime also being my own
film so being your feeling happening is like which is really hard it doesn't happen because because I don't hear to
my films music I don't see my film scenes again and again like how people see and how people think like a great
scene so like in the edit room one day I felt like from inside like what's happening with this guys like life you
know that very rarely happens right I was feeling bad I was rooting for him
and I called also R saying that dude what have you done like what is this you know but you know because it's it's a
see point is like when you when you write a scene and when you finish the screenplay and when you're going for the shoot you change few things while you
are little things not majorly but to hold that with you for 3 years it has to have something yeah if
you doesn't feel that it is not holding that for me I don't know about others but I lose interest right few scenes
like I thought like what I don't know how is it but in the edit when I see it
together it was like something else right so that that exercise is more painful and more interesting and more
very you know like you're at at the edge of the thing you know you're gone for
example J killing scene it can go wrong the flight goes up what I meant what I
was giving to the audience is likeah take off you know they say now from here
the story took off so that's where the that's that's what I was symbolically trying to say because I'm doing a little
bit of a CG Green Room CG also I'm doing it the first time I have no knowledge now I have a little understanding about
it so when he stopped the car when he got down there has to be shift of the music also because you can't take the
same background score from the car to the cidor to insert the room killing it has to be mix of bgms also and it should
not like suddenly something is coming it has to go with the feel of your Wizzle
where the Bacha is running towards the father from there it has to follow a pattern of looking like one family of a music you
know that see I think that was more uh I enjoyed that process and at the same
time I was scared also yeah yeah actually since you bring it up your work
in background music which you do that's very unusual because the cues that you give are not the typical oh sad means
I'm put playing a violin uh Happy means I'm playing some something like a you know like a the typical background skew
you go for very unusual instruments uh that leave us a little confused as to what is the emotion at
this point you know that's that that disorientation is something is that is
that because of the music or do you try to give that to the audience I always feel like for example if somebody's getting
angry there's a regular kind of pgms you hear in most of the films I don't want to use that I always try to you know use
a different instrument in a different uh emotion and see whether it's
working uh actually you know this uh this realization started I'll tell you
one sto backstory when I went to film School in Sydney so the moment I landed in Sydney after one week I uh bought a
car one of uh uh my friend's friend was living to Adel so he had this uh 1994 uh
toyoto Camry I bought that for $500 so those days 36 Rupees is the
dollar so it's like 20,000 20 00 I got a car I was excited so I used to go in the
car to the film school and there's one cassette there's only one cassette in the car left one side is STI mutam
another side is Sagar put the casset I was going I used to go via pit Street to
rosebury to my film school that's a route in the pit Street George Street I'm driving it's a big long Tower
buildings and I was like what's happening this
Visual and this audio I used to enjoy those drives every day only onti and S because only one casset
was there right so I there a gentle movies and Indian very Indian very Indian movies and it's in a white
country and uh those long big buildings in between and you see all in the red
light also you see only white CL running and this music S I like that that I used to there
was a time when I used to feel school I want to sit in the car play and going into different streets and enjoy this
music and that visual so maybe it started from there of from at that point I feel like using a very different
peculiar not a regular peculiar sound but a different sound in a different emotion and see how it works right that
X started there yeah is it true that that apart from ranir uh I read in an
interview somewhere recently that apart from ranir nobody knew the story the full story of animal is that true no
rashmika knew few people knew but uh an Anil s you know mock at me saying you
never told the story I told him but uh because it's hard to you know hold Anil s's uh attention so he'll shift into a
different topic and so that that way he felt that I didn't narrate the story but wantedly I didn't narrate to Bobby sir
because I didn't want him to know the story okay because I I thought like he's playing mute any he was half of the expression is gone when you're playing
mute I thought like I don't want to know the story it will I thought it will create something uh new in him because
keeping him in that not knowing the story yeah actually that helped that helped but rest of them I told I uh but
not because I accept that the the kind of depth with the emotion I narrated to
ranir for 4 hours I didn't do the same with everybody else yeah now you you said that you know he becomes an uh you
know like like Angry after he hears that his father is shot right but there is this this scene where for the first time
he comes back from America with his wife and kids and the brother-in-law vun is
his name he says you wait here you know like and he listens he doesn't say like
there's no animal bursting out and saying like he's my papa who the are you to say like let me not go inside
or something like that he calmly patiently Waits why does he wait no I I
felt like he's coming after eight seven years six years yeah six seven years and he knew that if he talks like that there
is going to be uh you know you know he doesn't want to create a issue there and if you remember rashmika says like
please don't do anything knowing his temperament so I I wantedly kept him quiet because he felt like this is not
the right situation it's not a 60th birthday party anymore to talk to him like that and he knows that if he comes
to know again he's going to feel bad and they're coming after so many years he just want to meet his father forget
about what's happening around he's very confident that you know he's going to deal once he gets his when the father
says like you know you know Papa watch out then that's that's
that's a way in a way father is also saying that you are not there in a very subtle way so I thought like when you
get that from the father then rest everything will with away so I didn't give any
that you take care like kissing on the hand godfa you came
back next thing is like he goes and talks to Shak and from there go a
factory I thought like I'll show the aggression in the factory in the factory yeah yeah you know that the way he was
saying those lines and all that I thought rather than showing there pushing the G I thought this let's not
do that so deliberately I made him sit quiet sitting with the workers where you felt also no you I felt like audience
will feel there you know yeah yeah and that's really what what for me at least why your films work so well because what
I expect you're not giving me okay because I would think think that when an angry son comes back or rather worried
son comes back and this GJ of all people tells him that uh don't see your dad now
I would think he just shove him aside and say I'm a son who the hell are you to tell me not to see my dad that's my
expectation right but you're breaking that expectation and putting that yeah now this is is this again an instinctive
thing or do you think that this is what the audience will expect let me do something different sometimes I do that
sometimes it's very instinctive to to be very friend because I thought um you know when a father will also ask him
yeah papa it's not important he say that's not important because he could have easily said you know the warun made
me wait but he'll tell to Shakti Uncle you know Mishra Uncle SOA you know you feel that yeah he's a
true successor and he's been that's why I wantedly made him smoking with the workers he just sadly smoking and he
comes he's shocked champ what are you doing here I thought this this is what I want to see this when when places like this I want deliberately make the
audience feel you know okay so that's what he says like you know when he says the Jesus is
and the cousins giving back you know those things we wantedly placed it like yeah right why does he go
to the pin I felt when I think personally when I think this also like how do you how do you judge a bodyguard
how do you trust him right because when you see uh big people with body go I have this feeling how do you judge that
guy he can easily come turn and shoot you just like that like how do you trust when you're having so much money I
thought like he'll because he knew that he has a lot of cousins so I thought like the Inner Circle will be more
secured if you have from your blood and brothers and all that so that's what he
says like you know that's that's a straight line from Godfather yeah but history has taught us something like anybody can kill anybody
yeah how do we trust them right then he I thought like in the in the group
picture also he takes that topic out but there's a strange Factor already
established yeah so I thought like that he'll go he'll reconcile the relationship and get the cousins that's a high moment I felt it's a very
cinematic High yeah and like you know they there's not dialogue I wantedly thought like let's see without a
dialogue and we I got the bgm we got the bgm before so I was playing in the set it was full of adrenaline all uh you
know yeah tall Punjabi guys coming and touching his feet and he's also like you
know an also baffled looking at who are these guys full of 12 people standing and when I was shooting when I was
looking at everybody I thought like we should have a dialogue the dialog was not in the script like R I like
something you should say a simple dialogue it will work it's a very simple and we heard 100
times but the placement is everything so so lethal at that point background score
quiet when he says all this Eco also little because there a high roof uh houses so I thought we add a little Eco
in the dialogue so all that worked yeah what I liked also about that is that we
see these very strange photographs of these sardars and all that in aril's
office and we like you noticed H great but it's there no like so I'm like who
are these people what are these strange photographs and all that and then you kind of yeah I wanted to create that but you know so many times you do few things
nobody notices it but you still want to do that good that you bought this nobody's asked me about this right it's
like it gives a feeling that you belong there yeah so I'm like these guys are not dressed in turbans and all that but
who are those people and like why does he have all that so there's definitely some story happening there so and then
you get this so it's like wow okay so that's the connection yeah so uh it's a deliberate brief given to my production
designer SES uh that we will will put this let's not put a closeup but maybe
in the background also yeah I like to put that kind of detail in the films yeah there's a frame that that uh May
mean nothing but I just love that frame when ranir brings ganali uh rashmika to
meet his father the bookshelf the bookshelf they're standing at the corner of this Frame and it's a wide shot and
you have that entire enormous uh wall to
flor bookshelves and they're looking like two pathetic like school kids out there tell me how you I wanted to give
that feeling that you know it's it's like he's your father but he's a powerful man yeah sitting with the chief
Min having a coffee so I wanted to create that you know you wanted validation call it you wanted your love
of your father everything but your father is not a regular father right now we said like girl of my house you went
out and you found the girl came back and and for him to come and show I think only when you are you know
unconditionally in love with somebody you can do that you know keeping your strength and ego aside and you walk into
the room and say papa you know I want you to meet somebody special that's what he says like you know when he's not
looking at him he'll say Pap don't think that with this you know
I'll come and meet and get married I'll sit at home he's still saying our equation is same right I'm still going
away from the hor but I want to know that this is the girl I'm getting myri so those bookshelves are kind of symbol
of the dad's power and position yeah I thought like and I hardly use any white shots entire film I have I think like
three or four white shots yeah yeah so I thought like this is the only situation see I I felt like see you felt like so
powerful also because of the reason also that you know I don't use just for the sake of using yeah they like two tiny
people there you know so and even the girl in the little frog it is making more school kids kind of a feeling he
also very excited having a smug on his face okay I'm excited that I want to show you to my father you know yeah the
question is also like that you want to sit you want to drink some water she say no you know yeah you know with this run beir again let's go back to his Arc what
made me so emotional at the end he's a beast trying to a protect his
father B get his father to love him the way he wants to love him and when he thinks that he has done everything that
he can to protect his father that gets leukemia yeah so he's going to lose his father anyway like after all this after
this murderous Rampage of of you know uh doing all these horrible things uh he
still can't save his father yeah tell me why did you want that sense of him being a bit of a losing things at
the end you're saying that like I'm saying you could have just as easily have reconciled them at the end right
but you chose not to do that you're like after all this this I'm still going to lose my dad my wife is walking away uh
before that I lost my hearing uh I lost my blad control bodily functions there's
so much that he loses yeah what made you go towards that direction actually this was when I narrated the 10 minutes idea
to that was there that time also this idea because this is where I felt like
you know I I personally feel uh with what my understanding on life is
U great things are shortlived right there's nothing like the way he comes and sits and says Papa let's go for a
holiday you know we we deserve a holiday it's life is not like that I I felt I
felt like you have not achieved anything in a way I want to say that you killed so many people I know they came to kill
you but but still you've killed so many people I felt like you know the the
church father says there's no Redemption a destructive force that's a fact people might be laughing because the way the
father got iritated but whatever the Swami G and father is saying they are facts even the Swami says like you
know 36 is the limit he says but I chopped the diog because the length he says 37 is your limit since he got the
heart so he's alive or is there's no because heart transplantation is today's
world is happening like 50 years back 40 years back there's no heart transplant that means you're dead so according to
the jatak and all he's gone I always felt in love stories accomplishment feeling should not be there I don't know
why I feel that maybe um I don't know the reason but I felt that will be more
dramatic in spite of doing so much you didn't get anything and deliberately I
didn't want them to hug also when they're crying I didn't want I felt like
you know the way he's giving back to the father is
saying is openly saying that because he's saying with a lot of pain and he walked away with that report if you
notice he's holding that report still feeling something can be done calling his friends in Us and something like
that when the father stops him and saying that the same thing what he wrote when he was a kid he's saying it now rir
gives a kind of expression what's the point if you understood now then he still walks away and I felt like he's so
helpless that he's holding Mishra unle and crying I don't know whether the dialogue you heard he says like Mish
yeah yeah I felt like this character never cries and he's saying you're dead
yeah Singh story is over right because he's never confused or he's like
that so I felt like I should leave the audience with that emotion in the climax
but I always had this feeling of a part two yeah so I thought like let's give a glimpse so I started that because
there's a there was a feeling for me strongly me and ranir majorly ranir strong felt like um the idea is great
but we should use this scene now even I thought like let's use it because which scene is this the the the chopper scene
the the butcher scene so I thought like I'll I'll take it little while I keep a blank screen for a while and then
use because I wanted to leave that feeling for a while you know but that
complaint I always have that feeling I opened the butcher but uh yeah right
because this feeling is going to continue for a while in the part two so I thought like okay when you see it like volume one volume two you'll be you know
you'll feel nice right at that point you know when ranir realizes that I've
done all this and I'm still a loser at that point he says let's do this play
acting you become the dad I'll become the dad and you become the son what made
you say that's the point I want this uh final frustration to kind of break out
there no matter he's saying he's saying that but he knew it's
gone saying like fourth stage third stage he knew that much and he's saying
I thought this is the chance I'm going to went out my frustration all my lifelong
yeah he's saying like only we'll do one day let's he says like let's do one day when Michael
Jackson came to India so so I thought uh even that water splashing on his face
and everything you know I thought there's a huge drama because you never seen him shoting on him you always
seen father is slapping shouting on him calling him Pig putting on weight we never see son doing it I thought it will
be very hard-hitting and Powerful when we make the son talk like that and even when the mother comes is like Mama you
stay outside it's between me and my father and I got this chance after 35 years so I don't know this very
instinctively happened I thought like maybe this is how this guy should behave at this point if he holds Papa's hand
and saying Papa don't worry I'll make it all right and they're walking in the lawn it's not going to work I thought
exactly what I'm saying you're you're giving me something that I'm not expecting at that point at all though of
course you gave me a series of things that I didn't expect so even at this point I was like okay I know there's this is not going to be a conventional
hug and papa that kind of scene is not going to happen so I kind of knew that was going somewh but this is something I
did not expect now tell me one thing what do Anil kapur's of course he loves
his son in a in a general way but is he also troubled by the boy like why is he
so violent why is he so like what is this feeling towards his son because I love that
line so why why does he say that it's like uh what does that mean because I
feel he's a he must have understood when he was in fifth standard only that he's a if when he becomes an adult he'll be a
very protective uh uh son towards me right he must have underst because when he sees how he's behaving with the
sister holding the rifle and going to the college and uh and he's saying actually
this is one line I removed it he says like what's the point of being so wealthy in life I thought like let's not
give that no the kid says say so you removed that wealth I thought like he
should not give idea that because kids get that actually kids who were 14 15 16 17 in that age if they know that father
is Rich right then they will play that accordingly based on G you know how the environment is at
home so when the father is not available only at home so obviously there's 100%
tendency that the kids fall into that trap of the we are rich you know somewhere see he slapped him he was sent
him to the boarding school but somewhere he knew that what a guy you know he's
did a wrong thing it's according to the law and order it's not right but Papa I know that he's a criminal but look at
his Fury look at the kind of you know at ude he has so so in a in a way he
admires yeah in a way he felt like maybe if you were here this wouldn't have happened right that's why I was missing
you so that's what I said that's a very subtle validation yeah the subtle thing that okay now we are joining our hands I
didn't want to show it in a symbolism but in a dialogue and even I if you notice he don't he's not knowing what to
talk that's why he's going on the chest hair yeah say I never saw you with the chest because he didn't know how to react
because because this kind of situation happened in the past then he knows Papa don't worry he'll hug but he never had
that moment so he don't know how to behave whether hold his knees or hold his hand or put a hand on his shoulder
so he's like he if you see R like a phenomenal job he did every shot he was
great but he's not looking into his eyes yeah he talk about that and immediately Shak Uncle comes and says you know
doctors were confused and the nurse comes and say that's over right after that father is shocked looking at the TV what is he doing in the factory so I
wanted to give that only I didn't want them to meet only yeah I have created a situation like that he from there he
went to the factory from there he goes to the pin he gets the cousins and it's out of order yeah he just go it's out of
his hands yeah so even the phone call sister is saying like he can't do anything he stopped at the gate yeah so
I didn't create a situation only where the conventional things will come yeah yeah so that was a hard part actually in the writing to not to create that
conventional thing and still jump in the screenplay and still make it compelling was actually to time actually right I
love the fact that uh because I love Masala Cinema so The Echoes when are a
big part of it so when the same japel goali comes when Bobby and and uh uh he
are fighting at the airport and he's almost being overpowered but then he remembers the dad telling him that and
like that's the man I have to protect and he gets that surge of power back uh
that was like a real Goose flesh moment actually what actually what I thought was even Bob sir has
a backstory like right you know I shot also but CG delay and I thought like
let's not because it's not fitting with the music for somehow yeah even when uh rir is hitting Bobby even there glimpse
of like 14y old guy 13y old guy running towards a grandfather grandfather is in the fire he's in shock that's where he
Los his voice and all that no I thought flash cut because I didn't want just for the sake of villain is a b guy
yeah he also has equal reasons to kill balir but somehow in the music in that pattern it is not sitting and I thought
in the edit only I thought let's not use it I will only use this there's many many funny moments in this movie but one
of my favorite funny moments is when d goes to pin gets all those people and I love Anil kapur's face when all these
people are touching his feet and he's like what the is happening here you know just like he's just going like like
oh God okay whatever you know so something's happening here I'm not understanding this so it's like that was
particularly gave look for everybody that is what which worked actually yeah he didn't you know ignore even not even
one 11 people everybody was looking at it because it worked yeah you you laughed at that point because he's yeah
I was I was just because the thing is he did not expect this because first of all there is a family history there yeah so
he's not even sure that see when he himself is so distanced from his uh relatives he would think his son is even
more distanced from them but for that boy to go there and get all these people back and suddenly he's like having a
mini family reunion at at one time he's not even expecting anything he's like totally like mind like he's gone like I
don't know what's happening and anel played that moment beautifully because it was like like uh you know he's just
like so confused you know what's happening here so uh that was lovely
yeah so did you see parts of this movie as a dark comedy because for me it definitely felt like there were parts of
this that were a dark comedy yeah okay did you feel that at all n there there's a humor which is very organically
unfolding I thought okay it's nice such a dark film I thought like little humor it's better so whenever it is
coming I didn't uh stopped it I let it happen even the prostitute scene and all that yeah I thought like yeah let's
let's go with the flow right when the when the cousins are with with those uh
women and all that kind of stuff it it was just a random scene there it's just a random scene I thought like I'll break
the eyes also because see either you celebrate with your cousins either you SC them then only you'll have a kind of
understanding or you're breaking the ice celebration I I didn't find any reason to celebrate for any other reason
because uh other than two three cousins rest of them are like a little strangers only to them because one guy is a fan
one guy the J is like kabu and all that it's in the in the entire lot one two
people are close to him but the rest of them are like I thought like uh it's a nice comic relief also it is and you and
now you individually you identify everybody what happened in the screenplay you say you see them like
bodyguards when rashika says like you know bodyguards he says like don't dare to say body they my cousins okay they're
cousins the first time you view him you see in the pin like group of people talking but you don't identify you know
really like who is who so I thought that scene was actually helped yeah it's like
to demarcate who's who but in a strange way that scene also has an echo because
he's telling these guys what if one of these women is a spy and later he gets a
spy uh in the form of soya so it kind of like like like kind of has a that's
that's why the in the in the swimming pool scene where he comes and says like you know the difference is we pay and
he's using his talent you know yeah so you both are you all equal then that guy
say he making the fruit juice or whatever it like now you mentioned uh
The Godfather I noticed quite a few similarities in The Godfather uh that
film also opens with a long celebration of a wedding and this one opens uh not
opens but there's a big 60th birthday uh celebration of of of the dad thing where
lots of things happen there also the brother-in-law is instrumental in betraying the the that's why the dawn
get shot and here too the same thing happens and there to Michael kills his brother-in-law and here rir kills his
brother-in-law and there to there's a scene where the his sister hits out at him for killing her husband and here do
that kind of a thing these are things that did you were you thinking of Godfather when you did these or did he
just accidentally happened this actually very uh organically because I saw God
for some 30 40 times yeah yeah so it's inside you yeah maybe yeah even even in Arjun and kabi they said there's a bit
of daas maybe you know I I've watched too many versions of daas so maybe so
that way it kind of uh thing because even that car explosion yeah that's there in Godfather too okay okay yeah
but in a different context definitely a different context but I wasn't sure whether you were like let's give a
little homage to Godfather kind of a thing or it just come organically I I didn't actually try to give homage but
uh I I knew this one this party thing it is it is a little similarities are there
right but sister thing uh he didn't uh Michael will say is still quiet about it
yeah I I thought like but telling to sister was a little going overboard
but it was it went smooth that scene was actually it was
unnecessary I thought he's making a point you know right because I feel like
I know this's one point where you say there's unconditional love which is happening in Arjun and Kabir but deep down you feel somewhere subconsciously
you notice everything right so I thought let's get that point also yeah so what
is the uh the reason you began with ranir at 60 because uh because keeping
part two part three in mind oh so you were thinking about that yeah I thought like you know maybe part two part three
the old man is narrating you know I thought um it's nice way of opening the
film with laughter and there's a relatively there's he's taking a monkey joke yeah
monkey is a kind of animal which has no control of you know you know this they
say you know like you know don't behave like monkey that means that so most of the times you don't have a control on it
and out of all animals the way you say monkey only you'll feel something about it I don't know the way you pronounce it
or you know so that's a very old joke in uh from Karnataka when I was in studying
physio I heard this joke 20 years back I don't know it stayed with me there was a time when when in the college when
somebody said they never used to turn back because you know what you're going to do he's going to do that so it was
that famous joke so because he start the moment is it's
like 100 years of swastic Celebration I thought like it will not be like 3,000 people it will like only close people 15
or 20 people that drunk till morning and he's talking about his father cousins must have heard that story like 150
times that's why they are like man how many times you going to narate the same story to me and he looks at
everybody and he says like okay you don't want actually there's a dialogue he says
I thought like when the edit I don't need that dialog also it is coming through his eyes so much that I there's
no need for me to use the dialogue right then he say okay guys I'll put the glass and I'll tell you a joke then everybody
are laughing he's just looking at them he's looking at in a way that okay you guys only need this yeah when you when
they're laughing yeah the camera goes in close to Rand and at least I thought I
saw a bit of sadness in his eyes yes yes yes thought right because because when you when you see father dying with
leukemia in the climax in the and you know that he's going to die so you don't
know how the death happened right so I thought like 6 you're 60 years old and you're still feeling for father that
means that Lely I didn't think of that because I've noticed my uncles and in my
in my real life also other people um people who lose parent at the age of 30s
and 40s and who lose parent at the age of 60 the pain is not say I don't know why it find I find it very strange but
is that monkey story also a kind of uh indication that we are still animals in
some way and weable of that is a straight inclination because we title animal so talking about animal yeah so
yeah we are not capable of change that's the the thing we are basically animals yeah yeah we are yeah because we have IQ
and we have communication we on the top or else would have ruled out you know
right so when you have these these scenes like he's walking around naked uh
like an animal uh or he has a very territorial Behavior towards his father or when he when he's like he tells his
wife let's make love in the open are these all things that came after you thought of him as an animal or these are
again scenes that you just did because they felt organic no this this is uh this is a feeling that uh it gives
animal uh you know characteristic feature like you know so she's behaving like human he's saying like you know
this is our private trip nobody's going to watch and all that and uh uh I
thought the the idea of putting the bed on the runway itself is uh it's a
different you know and we I don't know how many noticed we put the at the edge of the takeoff Point actually you know
those blue lines of lights so too much of detail I don't know that people have noticed but I thought they're going to make love and it's a takeoff point you
know symbolically I want to say so many things I don't know whether it can or not but yeah that's the major idea is
like can it's a very interesting idea and interesting thought also to talk with you know in a newly married
discussion it's very nice co you talk and next day morning suddenly it becomes about the father so I want to show that
difference also so after this you know you you have them and then the plane you said it symbolically the story takes off
and it almost hits the mountain but he goes up then comes the most interesting screenplay decision that you make which
is the plane vanishes into the clouds the clouds clear and suddenly a car comes into the frame
and a bearded like animal that that is the animal R that's the post like you
know that animal rbe gets gets out and suddenly he's going and killing his his
G there is no context why did it occur to you that I want the sudden jump to
this animal and then give the story of why he's killing the G yeah I just want
to give a shock value because if he comes back from years and he's going to
pin and get the factory it's again you're waiting you're waiting on what's going to happen you know what's going to
happen are very smart then he knew he because he
said establish the rift very clearly he tells to the younger one saying when I
was when she was getting Mar a form to control things but your
marriage I'll control so I thought like after this romance thing I want to give it it's call it cinematic high or high
with the masses you know that was a very deliberate attempt that you know I want the story to take off with a very high
cinematic scene because when you are killing J by then only few people I knew half of the HM will be in shock half of
the will be in like what a scene because because we are always rooting with the hero when it's a character film and if
somebody upsets hero you are not happy with that guy so he's killing and the way he got the power back from the point
where the way he's talking to him upset he got the authority there from there
there's shift of authority shift of so many things and you see those gang walking inside the room it looks very
powerful yeah and when we come back and there's a normal domestic scene where rashik is coming and hugging we've shown
some toys kids are sleeping that's now you know that oh now it's like 78 years ahead yeah and
suddenly Papa she comes then we go back to the story it would be an interesting uh or as I I felt I never
wanted a regular screenplay because we have seen this kind of stories yeah yeah only a screenplay and the
characterization will make it interesting right like you'll see half of the film you are done yeah you know ranbi takes so many
slaps from his father and from his wife yeah he never gets angry at all yeah like it's almost like he he kind of what
is going I feel he's beyond that okay because uh he knew that he playing with
a strap he knew that he's not supposed to do he gets SL that's why he'll have a smoke on his face you know that he's
going overboard but so he's pulling that brass STP why because I I felt see when
you have a little sprain or a fracture or a small thing on little putty you get
so irritated sometimes and things doesn't happen maybe your phone is not charging also you get angry because you
already have a splint so much has happened with him and
uh father wants the cousins to live and he's coming and sharting on the father saying that you don't trust me and his
all CES uh the maid comes and says like she's signing obviously doesn't want
everybody to feel that he's deaf so you throw the food and he feels the Gan should
understand about this and she puts a salt with the viscosity actually dial
viscosity he said Visos thickness yeah then he'll get he'll get angry like
so much is happening with me you're putting salt in my food in a very light way he says
like Po she's going and throwing the food she's preparing another new ball but I
feel for a man it will hit you from inside like wait what has happened with me she's putting salt in my food
that's why he's like okay now I'll play with you and he is a You Know M of cut out and he if you see first one is
like in a very lighter way he does that like in a very romantic way he does that after that then very clearly you see
when the camera comes front you see ranir growing in the frame with a little uh different kind of anger I don't know
how to say all put it in words he'll just bend like that and say what were you
talking to your mother knowing he knew that she will not talk anything ill about him but he always have this a
strange feeling with her parents because they have never met yeah because there was there was a scene which was written
which I didn't shoot was in the hospital the parents come to visit him so he'll
tell to ganali why your mother is giving me that kind of a look as though I'm bedden from one year it's only two days
it's only 10 days there should be hope I don't see any hope in your mother's eyes so from there we reach here so I chopped
I removed that but I felt like since you try to hurt me I'll try to hurt you
right so that's why I thought like you know when he came when he's leaning toward talking to her when he's pulling
the pony I thought like what else he'll do maybe he'll you know play with the strap and uh right no I'm saying this is
also some this is a for many people this kind of scene is a trigger point right because it kind of domestic violence
yeah domestic violence not yeah in a way it's like it's like you're
psychologically aware of why see no we you're aware that this is a very imperfect character but when you see
them doing this thing or when you see uh ranbi talking about uh you have a big
pelvis uh that that you have big hips childbearing hips one part of me is
understanding the character and saying that yes he is not a like a normal guy
so he's not going he's going to behave like a crude uh animal right but another
part of me is also like oh my God that's such a like a crude line so tell tell me when you put these scenes in or even
that scene where uh uh he she takes off her top and uh she's standing in front
of him and he's like oh my God you look so good for a mother of two what's what's running through your mind when
you put these scenes is it partly again shock value or is it also is it
something else it's a surprise value shock value and see he's when they had this thing in the school high school and
after that they were never in touch and um he's trying to say what has happened
in the past with his brother with her brother and with her he's saying about Alpha Beta and all that and he's saying
if you are in that situation bunch of herin alpha she's saying Alpha but he's not saying listen we had this emotion in
school and I really love he was not able to say that he's trying to come in a know different route explaining her
because it is the engagement day and they were not in touch and suddenly you know coming with that force and saying
listen Gan I really love you you know what has happened between us he can't say that so he's trying to explain a
theory which is related to his character also the title also for the film for the audience when they're watching it
doesn't seem like what theory is talking it gives a feeling that character that
is what the information we are getting and she walked away and while he was
talking he didn't even realize when he kept his hand on the feet yeah actually I thought of shooting B like you know
he's just playing with the pedals the flers and he just put a hand on her feet I wanted to shoot that but I thought I'll not show it then I figured out on
the shooting day itself let's not show that let's give again a shock the girl looks at me I didn't even realize that
you're touching my feet you didn't even realize M for the girl side you are engrossed in the discussion that's what
I felt like we'll convey that and very sweetly he'll remove the hand and he
also feeling that you know maybe I cross a line of touching it gives that look and she also gives a little irritated
look and she's walking away I felt like she's walking away he
knew without saying one more line he knew that she's gone so how should I say
that I'm seeing future with you I want to marry you so I thought like in this situations boys behave very differently
sometimes your intention is something else but you end up saying something else so he didn't know what to say then
I this was a brief given to rir Al I said like suddenly you don't know what to say G you got big
so he you are fat so he's saying he's giving a reason he's saying that I'm seeing future with you that you know we'll get married and we'll have babies
so that uh I thought that was uh compliment I never thought it's uh I
mean like you you found it uh ugly no see one part of me I understood that that this guy is not a like a normal guy
right it's like he's not going to tell like he's not going to behave with anybody properly leave alone men women
everybody be but that line because you have childbearing hips it it took me back to
the medieval times when women used to be evaluated on on like you know they they'll examine everything about a woman
and see whether she's fit for marriage or kind of a thing which doesn't happen anymore true so that's what was little
like it made me win yeah because he was he spoke about a stone age yeah right before into the discussion I thought
it's a continuous thing to say and U that's what I say so in the character it
fits but when you're watching it it makes you like go back a little and and kind of a thing so but tell me this this
foot thing that you brought up right again in that kvot scene he's touching her feet when she gets out in Kashmir uh
he's very lovingly putting the the winter boots on her naked feet when Zoya
comes he points to his foot and says uh you know like like kiss my boots if you
really love me what is this thing with feet throughout the movie It's like a no I feel in in a relationship every
everybody has a way of uh you know touching and cuddling and kissing everybody have yeah I thought like I
give this feet idea I mean like it's it's a I don't know how to put it but uh you know you have the idea of you know
in few couples we see they hold hand and they kiss on the dorsum of the hand and it's it's it's kind of their uh thing in
a relationship so I thought touching the feet or holding the feet his thing yeah
I thought it'll be yeah and um coming to that uh what you said about uh
removing the top and saying that one because I don't know how many people have noticed uh you know out of five
sense organs three are gone yeah smell taste and hearing so only touch and
vision is left so I thought that's the only thing which is working so for that
I thought he'll ask her to do that you know and he hugs and so he's so out of
shape so he's in a way complimenting saying you know look at yourself you
know that I thought that's a way of complimenting in a Rel guy now and father calls him a pig yeah and so I
thought like you know there's a line actually look at me and look at you but I thought like forget about look at me
says you know look at you mother of two kids and he signs I thought like he's happy for her yeah it's a nice
compliment uh you know relationship after so much has happened the strap thing and all that why did you have the
maid at the corner of the frame oh I want it because uh because if if when he if you if you notice when he'll touch
like that and he'll say like this the mannerism also like a b because uh I
didn't want to say that remove the top you know and even when yeah when she
she'll drop the chuni like that like I didn't want the chuni to remove and put it like that it's like it has to it's
like one drop and one lift it has to be like a b again then I thought like she if she checking the surrounding it's G
the romance is gone so I thought like forget about the surrounding he wants me to do this I'll do it for him and
there's a Focus Shift cu the same made where she got scolding so I thought like well it would be nice to shift on it to
show that how they're unaware of the surroundings right so I think uh I
thought that will be nice as a see like a romance right you know forget about the world it's that kind of a feeling no
in the sandip r Wanga world uh the women are also a little uh how do I put it uh
wacky uh they're not doing the things that the women typically do for example
uh in Arjun when he comes and sleeps on her lab actually there in this film too
there's this uh that's what I not yeah yeah yeah this is again a I was like is this sandep echoing Arjun ready or what
is he doing it's like where he comes near where the children are play the bathtub and she says come and then he
puts his r put his head on gitanjali's lap uh so it's like a very similar scene
to what arjuni does another thing is uh the women you show them as the
initiators of sex uh in Arjun RI also it's prti who initiates the kiss and
then the love making uh it's not it's not Arjun even though he's kind of a thing whereas here also there is that
scene where she kind of wears the lery and comes and uh uh she's like in this
this mood to make love and she comes in front of him I never thought this you never thought this I never thought this I swear I never thought this I'm like
I'm like why these women even this sleeping on the lap I never thought okay yeah because you never remember no no
now I'm surprised actually even this thought of you know they tried first yeah I never thought I thought this is
something that you're doing deliberately because no because they are like initiating this thing whereas the guy is
like he's like uh you know I'm not in the mood I'm I'm kind of uh you know
this this thing that thing that thing so that thing I didn't deliberately put the approach but I wanted to get into see
what discussion they had in the flight very other than you know don't talk about my father like that what do you
mean you know my father's a great father than that line I I want to show that this is a shift of discussion yeah you
know hardly they spoke anything and now suddenly you see there's a big argument happening I thought that would be nice
uh dramatic question you and it's very nice because there too your showing him as somebody who's so preoccupied with
something else because she says uh I'll be ready like this and she says okay she does this and he's like you're not
you're not you don't want to make talk to me anymore and then she goes back inside and then he follows her inside so
in a way she's kind of like he follows her around like uh he it's not like from
the US when you when you see people living in us the kind of Lifestyle they have and when you come and stay in a
house where the in-laws are there it is not the same for the because women are very independent in us especially Indian
women they you ask any most of them they doesn't want to come to India they feel it's much independent space right
you come to a I know it's a huge place it's a palace kind of a house but still in-laws staying and all I felt like
everything is a little in control now you know so I thought like maybe he must
be busy with so much things happening around so we are not showing that it's understood now in the screen play so I
I thought like what what will be the discussion between both of them yeah other than uh if not this so a regular
discussion will be very boring yeah so yeah they can't be talking about oh I'm so sorry about your dad or whatever
because again I want to make it you know I don't know why we have come here we are so happy in us so I want that thing
to happen so that I want to go back to the story so then you have that pattern so you have to place these things very
rightly we can't show any other thing other than that also but this is I never thought huh the sleeping in the lab and
all that have to be very careful now I never thought actually because
even the poster also unless somebody outside person said oh they're saying
specs beard the same poster they're saying like I didn't even thought about that so
I have to be really careful seriously because yeah but when we shooting I was
feeling like the way uh rashmika calls him come I feel like she's calling a kid
actually even on Arjun R it plays like that because had she not see she kind of
she's not like oh God this is so disgusting or something like that right she is she's actually calling a friend
and saying bring a blanket and she's she's like treating him like a baby yeah this overboard yeah yeah so this is also
you know I was like this is okay this is wife and husband but that's like she's new in the college that was a little
overboard but I thought like it will go well with the audience you know whoever is watching you like okay let's see what
happens for me I I look at your women being as nuts as the men and that's that's kind of they're also kind
of off you know like like they're not the regular women they're like they're little off which kind of when I say off
it means like for example in Arjun ready during that song I you know that's when you really know that that she's also
like like so extreme because they're going somewhere the motorbike uh
Accident Happens they fall down and instead of like uh dusting off or
checking themselves or whatever it is they run towards each other uh when the you know like with all their wounds and
bruises and blood and this and that so I'm like you guys are made for each other you know because both of you are so extreme here too you get that feeling
that only rashmika can probably control uh ranir yeah you know there's nobody
else who can his father can't control him of the sisters or whatever it is only she has true I gave a little hint
in few areas where you know if you notice she says like don't do anything yeah while taking the kid yeah and even
when he's sitting alone she's giving him that constant look saying like see you we have we just left everything and we
came and you don't even get to see your father what's happening that kind of look is there already and when the sister is talking also she'll check
ranir whether he's reacting or not then she'll say so that was very and rashmika killed
it that you transform and she didn't I mean it went very came very effortlessly in the look also we didn't
try much only through the dialogue and the way she's emoting we saw that six years of difference in the
Rel let's talk about that big action block right uh in that that open because
for me the film I don't like to talk about films and acts in terms of Acts
because it varies I don't believe that yeah I never understood that yeah but in this film I deliberately feel there are
two acts the First Act end of First Act he dies and the beginning of second and
then he's resurrected and then in a way he loses everything so it's like almost like two chapters of his life you know
because he that's that's how I I I saw this and even the fight sequence is
divided into three acts right the the first time he fights with the
uh with s with a regular gun gun with a gun the second second act he fights with an axe and then the third act he that
big uh Made in India atbar uh uh what do you call it at it's it's his line no no
what what is that thing called what do you call it like that that that that machine yeah it's a we can call it a war machine yeah a war machine so the that's
the third act right what made you say I just don't want one regular fight
sequence I want the scene divided into three acts with three different weapons yes yes yes that's a deliberate thing we
have divided with the music yeah I wanted it to like you know it's it's not ending it's it's it's actually maybe uh
the inspiration is from kilil know Kil if you remember one fight it's never ending yeah I I found it uh like I was
uh very hooked to it I saw it multiple times and it is holding my attention like it l fight still it's about 20
minutes right I think I think yeah I think it's 20 22 minutes yeah so I thought like you know there will be
group of people coming coming coming I thought with the music and there's a dialogue in between there's changing
flowers and you know breaking the Box there's so many things happening like a scene there's a discussion in between
where the you know the Freddy guy comes and gives a description that's terrific casting by the
way he's a great he's a great actor I'm like the casting was so bang on it was
and that tiger underwear yeah even that dialogue is his idea that sound is
making that sound it's his idea and at line is that he read the line he said
like you know manufactured in Bangalore made in Maharashtra Made in India he said like sandip let's use
this I like super abuse it then it was yeah there's a full you know whistling
and cheering in the theater for that line right so you divided it as one yeah yeah and of course the song
happened then and AR and it just became viral because
of of this every every bit of the film is viral every even the you see so many
people are parting putting the glass it's it's Madness I we never thought
that level so this kind of said you you saw Kil and said let's also make a you
know I thought I was surprised you know usually in in in our films especially in the South films few
action episodes we'll be bored so that maybe happens because it's
happening only in one particular area there's no dialogue or there's no break in between so I when I first time saw
kilil that fight I thought like very smartly done it's like a scene it's not Action episode so that I don't know that
remained in me I don't know because when in the few review writers said that kilbil action he must have inspired then
I felt like yeah I saw it because when the first time I saw I thought like what a scene it was yeah so and
being a Punjabi guy I thought like with lots of money and attitude I thought like he'll make a machine for himself
you know yeah so in the starting also we establish that Freddy and all that they leaning to that
box they were eating so we established properly from the first scene even the
underwear irritation and all that so that you know there extend away so that plantings was done properly so that
you'll not feel suddenly because we reaching to the interval right you know so few films we see that reaching the
climax they rush so what is that underwear irritation scene my brother
who's a producer on this film he live he lives in us for this film he came back and he's doing two and four he's shling
between us and Bombay he he produced arent as well right yeah yes yes so he always used to say what is the problem
in India the detergents you know the texture is going wrong I used to think what he saying is true because because
because the detergent and the water uh the use softners also for the water that all there but we don't have it in India
so yes this is something wrong with the detergents of water that remained in me when he complained when he was saying
this like long back 15 years back so I thought like let's put this idea and you
know what like you pull up your socks you know tighten your balls when you're going for a fight so I thought like this
guy taking that guy's underway putting it a camera going like that the drum sound with the marati song I thought
like it would be fully entertaining uh you know moment and tiger and tiger
Triplex tiger so we only designed that brand and we use the tiger sound also on
it right so yeah so it is purely for fun and you know yeah yeah it is mad yeah
it's like why are all those people dressed in animal uh wearing animal masks because I understand ranir is an
animal yeah I wanted to get a little different flashy different effect on it
okay and one more thing what I thought majorly thought was you know whoever the fighters are
whichever film you see the fighters are same right have you noticed yeah I can't cast Fighters see in the film in the
60th birthday party in the classroom scene when ranir picked the rifle I chose every Junior
artist by photographs I have casted literally one by one like I want the
junior artist also to look in a specific pattern and uh look so I can't cast fighters fighters are Fighters
you see the same action guys actually I've seen that even the dancers you see the same yeah when I was a kid I used to
notice especially in wenes songs there used to be one guy who is there for seven eight years for almost 30 songs
the Frontline dancers you know all the faces yeah exactly yeah like that even the
fighters we know a lot of them they they'll be dang they'll be in ch film
they'll be in rajin film and suddenly they'll be in a small set of film also like four CR film also they'll be there
so I thought like how to hide them and this is a a film which is happening in
Delhi so and that to you know that somebody's attacking from a different country he's hiring people no matter in
India but he'll not hire the same faces right the moment you see the Fighter's
face I felt like you lose the real realness of it right uh the authenticity
of it so I thought like how to do that I thought like well let's cover let put Monkey C
idea was a monkey cap first monkey cap is regular let's make animal B title is animal
so I told to Sur and Sur got it designed and uh it took a while we actually a
time there that we have pushed the uh you know uh this interval for another 20
25 days because the masks were getting ready because I was thinking like I I I
I definitely feel it wouldn't have worked the way it is working looking now if I show the faces yeah the fact that
they are autonomous makes it a little more uh scary in a way it's like a
little don't yeah because face you know the expression with the A and all you see the but this like some everybody has
the same expression yeah yeah know when they're turning and when is doing this calling it looked very scary because you don't see them yeah like like a joker
mask so I thought it will best for the film you know or else you see if you
have faces also now you feel like right there's no expression the
people are dying so you didn't really feel B fight actually it helped the the
length of the fight fight yeah yeah again I don't know if this is intentional or you're going to say I didn't think of it but all your bad boy
Heroes they high Achievers one is a super surgeon one is a spacecraft
engineer in animal what is that I don't know uh it's just a professional that
you think yeah I think U maybe I want my heroes to do best everything they're
doing I don't want I don't know I never thought also actually okay the topper of the college topper of the University I
never thought it just came while was typing the dialogue I don't know so that's what it's like it's a flow yeah yeah it comes from the unconscious yeah
yeah basically maybe I love to deal with smart guys maybe know like messed up smart
guys there are some lines in your in your films like uh here there's a line that happiness is
a choice happiness is a decision a decision yes in Arjun there's this this this lovely line that says suffering is
personal it's not the suffering is that's all that's one thing but also there's this lovely line that uh arjun's
dad says flash hurt yeah it's not the good boys that H is the flashbacks that follow these are your lines or are these
are they like things you've read long back I heard somewhere must have heard I didn't but suffering is personal
happiness is a decision I felt it right I felt and and I WR but that line I read somewhere basically I'm asking are these
your philosophies I believe in them yeah I definitely believe happiness is a decision yeah it comes within us only
and if you really want the environment should not affect you you can be happy always right tell me about the timing
decision for two things one is where the title animal appears yeah and two is
when the hero Reveals His Name these are two very specific decisions that you've
taken yes why did you say I want this at this point and I want that at that point so actually uh when when I was thinking
how the film is going to begin I didn't find a point where I have to put title right or else it will feel like okay now
everybody know that you're coming and watching animal why you should push saying that okay now see the title I
didn't find a space first thing another thing I felt it will be so cool playing that Orchestra kind of a music after
killing and they eating and quietly it will settle with like a step pencil and
with a gunshot the gold is filled I thought like that's a very powerful image people clapped at that point yeah
I thought I was like dreaming because suddenly some some special effect kind of thing started coming start SL it
fades in the circle out Circle and the Inner Circle yeah so I thought uh that will be a nice way of presenting the
title and name I because every time he because he loves
his father so much I always wanted him to say b s and even in the Press they
say that the first time we hearing a third generation entrepreneur not willing to take his
name calls himself balir sing Kaba I don't know how much it is heard while he was going to pin so when it
comes and even when he says to his rash's
brother all the time is saying n n name and all that audience will
feel I think that's a way of holding attention on a different aspect with the
story drama music everything there's another line I thought which which will be nice for the audience to hold it and
give it at a point where you feel with that PGM when you
hold down and saying the echo I thought like that's
where you know I thought it's a very you know cinematic High as for the character also I feel like it's a nice reveal yeah
because we we given like three four situations where you feel even the cousin say like by so Nam even even the
father also never calls him vij in the climax only rashmika says vij I'm leaving you yeah VI when he stops
him only twice we hear his name that in the climax and throughout I maintained
in the dialogue that nobody calls him with the name right so I thought that's a nice uh way of of uh people they're
thinking while you're watching the film that's nice way to make the audience think right okay now comes one of my
favorite things in the movie The doubling when Anil does not come home on his birthday Anil kapor does not come
home on his birthday the child ranir goes to his mother and asks uh she says
your dad is so busy we'll have to clone him yeah but he says not clone make a body double
later he actually makes a body double of his father yeah and much later somebody
makes a body double of him of ranir at the end right there's this other thing where abr's wife gives birth to
identical twins like like that's what they say right at the middle of the fight what is this constant doubling
going on no because that's this see this is deliberate like as you asked you wanted do it or it's unknowingly it's
very deliberate because uh because one thing I feel like fifth fourth standard
cloning or body double that's always a thing to ask but I thought like it's okay maybe he understood that so
probably a super smart guy or something yeah so maybe he understood cloning at that point in '90s
so uh I thought we'll give the idea of body double and hit it which is a nice planting and payoff yeah and in the
climax why I uh because see he's Abus see Bobby deol's marriage and everything
is actually domestic abuse yeah marital rape call it anything you know you know
but when you see they are not willing to reveal the details about where he has
gone I found very fascinating when when I was thinking about the scene that
he's ill treating is a small word to say but they are giving him that respect and
all that even she's having a labor pain she's not willing to take you know where he has gone
so I thought when the cousins come because they are loaded guns in the flight and they're going to kill and why
this fist fight is happening why to shoot you are 12 people and there have four people that's what the Royal comes
and he say then he'll
say said when he says that for the effect of it I did it's like that that
women has delivered a baby boy instead of saying twin you know twins identical twins this is the emotion to it when you
say it and Bobby doesn't know about that so while I was making it editing it for
me emotionally there's a shift towards Bobby I actually shifted while I was editing I like why you killing him I got
that feeling and most of the audience also felt yeah I spoke to a lot of people they felt that for a moment we were on the Bobby's side yeah because of
this aspect because if you see revenge is Revenge end of the day you know he also wants to emotionally same you're
doing for your father he doing for his grandfather so yeah so I thought like in
when you say identical twins I I felt like it is doubled the emotion is doubled yeah two kids are going to be of
now right there another eight kids so it will be like you are worried about your father
one son imagine there are eight kids yeah yeah and you don't know what's going to happen that's what Sur G will
tell grandfather you just forget about this right away here yeah then he says like
uh you know something like that actually that's when I got the idea that there's
probably going to be a sequel because when he said like I was like okay this looks like something that's going to
continue but that's amazing because you set up when ranir is a kid the point of
the body double the payoff comes at a very unexpected point when the dad is
shot and he creates this this body double and that's like like seriously uh
think now again you could have without the setup itself you could have still had say I'm creating a body double
because everything is Extreme anything is possible so he could have still done that what made you say I want to set it
up then as a child set up this body double concept as when the child is still there yeah I thought I just wanted
to you know show that he a smart kid he's able to gauge that you know that
okay father's a busy man I'm okay with it right you know because the way he's emoting also no matter what Papa just a
queing his mother is shocked the way he's saying cloning
she's like Whata going to deep detail and K is
going to the factory right so I thought that just to give that you know strong
intention and give that smartness thing uh and it's nice know that it's unfolding and it's planting and paying
off yeah plan and pay office is really really like at at at the most unexpected moment so that's what really works like
the other doubling is there's this there's this twice it com
like then reverse it and then the next janum finally you will learn from this
janum and you will become the ideal Papa and I will become the ideal beta tell me
that that Jan Jan you're saying that this will always happen like never end
see there's way of explaining when you say it when you talk
in a way if at all you little mad on the topic you say h you say it in such a way when it happens if if if if is always
there but there's no if in this if you notice in the
line so I I felt while I was removing the ifs in the dialog felt like it's
very new he so sure the shity of having a Janam Janam is showing that the vast
love you know you know how much he loves his father to what extent right shows
that it's a little um uh you know like uh very stupid to say like agum AG what
nonsense you're saying nobody knows what happen agum but in a very um what you
say very poetic way uh you're so sure of three four uh lives so that shows that
depth of a relationship that's why I used as a first publicity thing uh to say like what this story is going to be
like two years back we left audio teaser saying this this like of the audio teaser so just give a idea to the
audience that it's a story about Father and Son yeah for me the most interesting visual in the film is you go to an
extreme closeup of ranir with a beard and uh you know like
like there then it's almost like the a screen lifts and like if you stop
halfway you see a beard you still see ranir here and then when the screen fully lifts you see it's actually Bobby
yeah one did you cast Bobby because he kind of looked like R I don't know I'm just like asking is uh no okay okay it
was just an inspired bit of casting that's it it's just why not Bobby do yeah yeah I saw one of the picture CCL
car celebrity cricket league he was holding a water bot and looking into the ground I really loved the expression I
show it to Bobby sir also so this is the reason I've come here like you know showing the picture right so yeah that's
that's I always wanted like I I want the audience to wait se's
you know how the health is going down and wa to a point where maybe he's imagining things there's nobody actually
I didn't want to open in the casting that there's Bob deal in the film this thing for me I felt I'll not
let the world know that there's bobel in the film but today's thing it's very hard to hide yeah when you're not hiding
then then let's put a poster also because I want my willing to be revealed oh this is what it is yeah I
couldn't give that because digital information we can't hide things only unless you do it in a studio
completely but the beautiful thing about that is it positions them as like almost
like twins like two sides of the same cont and when you're saying brothers so
all this was in mind but still it worked knowing because when I was writing I thought nobody knows this Bob in the
film yeah and I'll open like that and the high is bit four five times than what is it now in the Thea but now but
still it worked because my fear was that only because when when when I was shooting the idea was that but by the
time I reached to the location then it's it's out even in the audio teaser also I
was thinking whether to put Bob's name or not but I thought like if you hide today anyway it's going to people will
know that he's there so let's use his name right and another thing is this guy cannot hear yeah that guy cannot speak
yeah yeah that that again was a yeah yeah yeah because uh because there's one
line actually when tripti confesses to him and when he says like I knew the day one
you are she she actually uh you know she'll curse him there a lengthy dialogue I removed it I didn't shoot
only she'll say like you know what's the diff this there's no much difference between you and your brother the
difference is like he's mute and you're deaf it it will come in a very powerful way when she's saying I thought like
let's not use this we'll use in the climax because so much of punching is happening so obviously that goes away
yeah so he's trying to talk and his brother will say and his brother will say I knew that people will laugh and I
felt for a while that Hing the emotion might come down but the music is so high
so nice those lyrics are so it was holding yeah they laughing at the same time they are like into the emotion of
the you know actually I wasn't laughing I was I was actually very moved because
uh that's one of the rare times I don't know if I've ever seen a fight scene where you you have such an emotional
song happening usually you have again that's that's the music cues that you give right they very off very uh off the
beat and track so sometimes it takes us a while to process because we're used to
like like I said sad scene means violent you know happy scene means this but here it's a fight you're not going like
fullon you know electric guitar or whatever it is to Rouse the emotion you're making it sound like a very
emotional event that's happening there's a chorus to the chorus yeah how did you
decide that that was going to be a very emotional moment day one I was having this idea that and the hero and the
villain comes into the picture first the first time looking at each other and if you see R we'll be seeing like oh this
guy this is what I was waiting for he gives that so I wanted like you know in
the climax when the lovers meet there's always you know always you know like a
symphony kind of a music he's playing I thought why don't we use it for the hero and villain yeah and it's a Punjabi song
and it's saying about relationships about father predominantly so I thought sorry that will work even that's
why I was because I was playing uh in in my in my phone it's playing like that and I was watching in
the Monitor and there's another speaker also which is playing for the actors so
I was very keen we were very close uh tis when po coming down R is coming down
and they're looking at each other and walking towards like that it's a old scene we've seen hundreds of films
sharar but I thought that that song and that placement and in between they're talking he's stopping the cousins and
he's stopping his brothers yeah that you know equally we want to fight and the ethics were same from both the sides so
and villain is not playing uh dirty yeah he also have that equally thing like I you know I'm going to take him down so
all that worked yeah and in the middle you're getting that information about identical twins yeah yeah and they're
exhausted and smoking also all that really worked it was very uh is it true
that you wanted a kiss to happen between rir and yeah actually yeah actually there's a kiss he'll heill kiss who will
kiss uh Bobby will kiss ranir okay but it was superb on the shooting what kind
of kisses it it'll kiss on the cheek when he says like by you know you'll I didn't even spend one day with my father
if you you say you say uh you're leaving it and I'm going to leave you and he's
he's convincing him and he'll come and kiss on the cheek and he'll go back and open the zip so that it was nice but
with the music and before he low the zip yeah okay I felt like Kiss is diluting the zip so I thought why I removed it
because Bobby are expression he just gives a smoke like that and you see a tears going I felt that is more bigger
cinematic High than coming and kissing so I thought like I got through that tear ear rolling and that smoke he
gives what you saying you did so much to my brothers and now you're saying forgive me I'll go away it's not
going to happen so when he's still talking he'll take two steps back and he'll open the zip and then run R
figures out that you know he's not going to keep for now yeah and I like that zip moment because it again goes back to the
monkey story yeah yeah yeah yeah you know yeah so that's like everyone's this
equal anim out there like like like they're all behaving the same same way
there's a clear indication that willing is putting the zip is saying like
that sometimes entire heroism might die in the climax what happened but the way
rir looks at it like that and even he's having tears and he removes a cap of the
knife it really went the way is taking the turn the nice Sunset is happening yeah all that really helped the scene
like super there is one thing I'm very curious about uh again between Arjun RI and here
in Arjun RI you begin not begin opening scene is that two people by the sea but
when the grandmother starts talking uh you have a bhagat Gita uh Sanskrit
schloka yeah yeah that that that that talks about time right in Kabir Singh
it's a Kabir Doha which talks about time here again there's in uh animal there's
there is again that Kabir Doha at the point where the fight is happening tell
me about this bits of ancient philosophy that you put into your movie this is this uh because sidat garima wrote
dialogues for Kabir Singh so sidat understands telu so the kind of bhagat
Gita thing I used and now it's titled Kabir Singh so it's their idea that we use Kabir do uh in the beginning and the
end it will go with the title also and but in animal uh uh it's it's not
deliberate I don't know how because I always wanted to me and sorup thought like you know he's the bigger bad guy
than everybody yeah he's saying basically I looked inside myself and there was no one worse than me yeah
right yeah so why is he telling it that at that point because you you bought the machine out and you are like you know
you know how the they're flying like ants you know right so I thought before getting there I think this line will
work with that smokey effect that yellow light right so yeah initially we thought we'll use it in the quar before firing
then after that uh we used it there so another uh not lines but bit of music
that you use is like when Arjun R sees PTI for the first time you use a song
that's a goddess song yeah yeah yeah right yeah in so when ran sees ganali uh you use Ro
that's Ro that thing is it's like a love song to a like a woman placing her on a
pedestal right what is that that introducing the girl with that song yeah
it is it is not a deliberate thing but thing is uh big fan of uh rman work yeah
especially Roa bomb and all that and uh I want it to sound uh very real because
they are partying in the ground floor on on the top of the roof there is a engagement happening so more than the
background score I wanted to use on the atmospheric sounds FY background sounds sounded very real then I thought like uh
let's use this uh rman s song because the trior band who created this song
they were in Arjun R audio function who came and they playing the band okay before the crowd you know started
walking and sitting so they were playing few tracks I was like who are these guys
since then I was having I was in touch with them I was watching their videos so
then I found this Zan song and then I contact them I said like I want to use this as an introduction from the bike
from I started in the classroom itself time so so I I like the idea of using a
sound some in a particular uh place and you come to the nucleus where it
actually started I like that idea I don't know why but uh but it's uh it's not deliberate that I want to use music
when I'm introducing the hero right uh the idea was to be like very question because you made only two films so it's
like but it's but because it's happening I'm asking so yeah no it's okay because I I I wanted it to be more real more
realistic yeah that's that's the only idea right right and uh it's such a famous track I thought immediately you
are into the story yeah that music will help you know four five times more than a regular uh mean if I would have asked
ramesar to give a background score it wouldn't have worked the weight is working with ro because the Nostalgia
always helps helps yeah and it's plus set in that time and yeah yeah yeah okay you're going to kill me for this but
again in both your films there's an intercast marriage yeah okay you didn't notice
this either yeah intercast this the interstate intercast yeah it's not a
signature n i mean it just happened yeah because
uh because this I I see a lot of uh and Tamil family settled in Delhi right so
it just uh yeah maybe I like seeing inter you know region marriage intercast
I mean one of the biggest highs in the movie is when she they're sitting in
front of her family and uh they don't say anything but they kiss and the music
of Who Am starts right it's like the Prelude of H starts and then that that wonderful electric guitar that sound
goes it's such a wonderful rock song yeah yeah and then you kind of take off into that zone I want to know why did
you choose like why did you and your composer choose that to be a rock kind
of like there's a recklessness in it there there is a recklessness in the Rock because it could have been a melody
song also right it's like a yeah yeah you you you feel it's it's voicing out your rage and it's very Rebels yeah it's
it gives a very young feeling they're very uh you there's a bit of negligence also in that you know uh this is what we
are you know so I thought like after coming from such a big drama of what's happened between him and his father 60th
birthday G sister everything after we see what he has done in the school I felt like he should not explain himself
I wantedly made him sit in such a way that they already he heard a lot from
them but we as audience we were only listening a little end part of it you
know I just wanted that to happen the brief was like like you hearing this from 10 minutes you understood that they
are not going to understand whatever we try to explain them so let's give them
you know that most unexpected thing to see after that there's no talk how to how to shed them yeah please don't talk
like that we are really in love from the childhood you can't you he'll never say that even the girls will never maybe you
know because he's stunn on it so I thought this is a nice you know it's a nice takeoff point
from there so when you guys sat down to compose you knew it was going to be a rock song yes yes yes when I because uh
pram are composed it when I braved him also uh I I said like I wanted to be
like that I wanted to have those you know that uh passionate voices in
between when uh this guitar and this is happening because I told him the scene this is what it will be in the flight
and all that right it will be rebeling in front of the parents and going away in a way it's not running away but very
elegantly getting up and walking out you know you you know so I that I I explained him and uh this happened in
the pandemic actually this brief happened in the zoom call and yeah right and then it's like they're on the ground
next minute in the sky yeah it's like on straight you know yeah yeah so you know you say soulmates and when you're in the
flight you always say like you know so many Souls on the board there's a little symbolism in that I don't know how many people understood it I thought this this
was a brief for pram sir you know when I narrated him you have a very good sense of Music yourself or do you explain very
well what you want are you so specific because every single song that you've
had has really worked in this nobody knew what Jamal Kuru was and it's like now it's now viral Arjun nobody like
like that's become a a thing like is this all no because I I listen to a lot of music uh uh I can't imagine myself
without music even I can't write a scene without music and sound at least at least I have you when you're writing you
play something all all the time no I I have to know like what kind of a music in the background or if not music what is the atmospheric sound whether it is
set in a low roof house or a high roof I don't know why it's a pain actually because it will stop your writing if you
don't get that Clarity and so what I have inculcated the Habit after you know doing some short films in austral in my
film School whenever I'm writing a screenplay I have a mood material like if even Arjun had I collect some
photographs random photographs which I think I can see Arjun r in it I collect
few photographs I collect some music pieces writing job you is like self motivation yeah yeah yeah you have to be
motivated all the time it's not easy wor because one week you right after that you might lose interest so to keep
yourself motivated on the subject point I collect some audio and some
photographs so like that I collected a lot of music for animal I started collecting during Kabir
only I'm I'm shooting Kabir but something if I see I feel like it's going to for my next film I immediately
take it and put it in you know save it in the computer or a phone so this song
this a Persian song I selected it like 4 and a half years back so randomly one
day in between the shoot I visited my uh folder my mood material of animal I scrolling scrolling up I found one music
piece I said like wow this is what I thought for Bobby the's introduction then luckily we got the
permission and we red it a little remastered kind of a thing we did and we used it working because sometimes when
you're deeply involved in the story you you know very well whether you want a real sunlight or you want uh you know
just afternoon light or a morning light that that it's just a feeling there's purely no calcul purely feeling and uh
that's how it happened and I'm maybe I listen to a lot of music and specifically I'll tell them this is
what I wanted I think that's why every time every song every bgm is standing out because I'm very clear with what
sound I wanted right right and you're also trying to break the cliche of the of yeah because you know if you remember
when the Father and Son discussion is happening there's a siren used when he says
uh seeing at the 15year old's rage saying he'll go to jail there's one
siren I used where an will be going back like that that siren and the mement in the frame is in the sink yeah it sounded
like what a piece of thing you know music is playing at that point so even when uh even the theme the visil theme I
use with that you know uh I use it like I know how how what do you call that
instrument that will come like that that visual theme Papa's Papa's theme I use it like a rage thing now you know so
like that yeah yeah I think I'm very
specific maybe that's the reason yeah right right why did you want to make abrar a Muslim see I thought I'll tell
you because I feel I've seen people when when they hit to a zone of zero
confidence people will come and uh you know uh say that go to uh the church or
go to some Baba he'll give you some tabis change your name things will work for you things like that happen we have
I've seen people changing their religion because so much has happened to them that yeah in a low point they feel like
it's a new birth the change of identity completely so I felt when the other grandfathers
kicked out of swastic I thought he's done somebody must have suggested
him so I thought like we see a lot of people converting into Islam and
Christianity we never see anybody converted to Hinduism yeah so we we see a lot happening in the surroundings so I
thought like I'll use this because in in Islam there's multiple uh times you can
get married so I can have multiple cousins with different faces the drama will be bigger that's the only reason
yeah there's nothing like you know okay you're a Muslim I can show you know bad light or you can show it like a villain
yeah because few people are writing you know like why you you made Muslim as a villain no I was just curious because
you have a sik protagonist or or a Punjabi and then I was just curious about the line because just like I'm curious about why they go to church uh
that scene with the church it's like uh because when things like that happen people suggest like you know that's what I said now go to that Baba go to this
church and uh even even that hom which is happening it's purely South Indian thing yeah so I thought like uh you know
when somebody is sick at home you try to seek blessings or speak spiritual things
from every possible religion so it it depends on what kind of a family you
strictly you don't want to see any other religion then you'll only strict to Hinduism right so I thought like a father is like open guy so I thought
like okay let's go to church let's go to there here there so that's the reason I use Church like let's cure this guy yeah
like you home home happened immediately Church happened everything is happening and that's why you see an G is looking
at him he's saying amen amen and all that you know and also that that home home there's a nice touch because rashmika is familiar with that with that
concept saying hold this do this do that there's one line the cousin
says so I thought there's no need of the dialog I chopped it in the edit I thought like it's understood the way
she's asking him to do it's understood why say it again with that that and rest
of them are just standing is there but he don't know the ritual how it works why does he
tell ganali like uh if I die don't
remarry I see in a relationship uh sometimes you know most of the times I
feel uh in in relationships you are done the rest will be a habit multiple
partners could be habit once you are with one person the share of love with that particular person you are done for
the life you know that could be the exchange between ganali and ranay and knowing the psyche of ganali there's so
many things in a relationship which is unsaid so he must have felt that you can't make it with anybody else so you
better remain single so because knowing her mother and parents they might suggest to if I don't
come back that okay now happened is happened after maybe after 2 3 years they come and tell you that no let's get married and he doesn't want
his kids to be seeing ganali with another father maybe that's his thought
yeah it has nothing to do with a generalized feeling it's between it's purely personal so I know that because
people looked at especially the Pudo fist looked at it saying uh oh he can go and sleep with another woman but he
doesn't want her to uh you know marry again I found it very funny but because
I'll tell you to to to an extent they they felt like why is he introducing pry
in a White costume CU he want everything to be fair but this fell is I don't know
that uh this angle of how they dissect your film is gone from Arjun from Kabir
to now in this four years the meter has gone up somewhere like it's it's too toxic now
no it's it's also I think these are the very unique things that make the films
extreme because like you say the drama comes from the from the fact that you're pushing the material right and I was
like one of the things that that that I really like about your films is that
they they kind of really push you provoke you shock you they move you uh
they do everything like usually when you see a love story for instance you're like I want to be
moved but you're giving like all these other uh like things your your kind of
like the the this is one big Tali of emotions that you're that you're giving and I'm not prepared for it like because
it's like so it's like watching somebody without a filter you know like uh that's
refreshing because usually people always like look through a film with or a
character with just one gaze and here you're like like you're just like I'm going to do what feels right at that
moment for that character rather than like try to you know do this whole thing
in a certain way and I think that's very refreshing uh to watch in a film to have a villain for instance for just 20
minutes I think it's unheard of because it's like usually what the the traditional way of of of of thing is you
introduce the hero maybe either you introduce the villain or you wait for like uh something interval point or
maybe Midway somewhere so that people know that okay there is is an antagonist that is going to kind of a thing but
here he kills his brother-in-law at that point he introduce the villain's brother we don't even know who that chap is when
he dies there's a phone call and that is when the brother dies there's a phone call and then you realize oh there's
somebody else and then there is this uh explanation about the family and then
the villain is revealed the actual villain it's like a it's a very different way of writing that's what I'm
talking about and uh thinking that audience are with you yeah is one very scary uh ride if if they lose one or two
bits they'll not follow but how do you what is this conviction that you have S it's like you're you're doing everything
against like like what is usually done like what is this conviction that
you have how do you get this this because we we we are very clearly I'm very clearly underlining things right
which it's it's not easy that that you will not notice it you have to notice it
you're making it uh very uh thickly underlined everything that is one thing and another thing is I don't know the
other way the other way bows me the thing is if if I don't make the flight go up like that see all that mountain
all that CG thing so many hundred meetings with that just to give that high of a takeoff in a story then what
way would be to jump into screenplay like just putting after 8 years it's so boring it's it's because when you see
like oh what where where this is going and suddenly you see range row and suddenly this I'm not giving time to you
to think so I feel very much I'm holding the attention so I thought like all this
Snippets what you said phone call brother yeah reveal I thought they are always with me right so but at the same
time sometimes you feel what if they don't really bother about a storytelling then you are dead I used to get this
feeling in Arjun also why I have to look at your story why is he pissing you in pants
move on with your life what if audience think like that but the whole idea of making a film is to you know I'm going
on a ride just follow me throughout the ride yeah that's what a strong screenplay is always right right that's
a challenge and that's a that's the only way to do it right right I want to talk about the Zoya character again because
you don't explain every little bit in your in your movie but just give enough hints there is this uh with gitanjali
uh she shown in a very like almost like a very chased virtuous manner like like
like even after the love making or whatever she's coming in a sar like a bridal SAR kind of a thing and all these
kind of things whereas with Joya you actually see her like naked and uh he's
resting uh on her hips so that image how did you like conce that image
that you want to show a 180° difference yes yes I want to show the difference difference and uh and one more thing is
uh uh obviously there's a little nudity in it but I don't want I didn't want to
sound SAS I want the audience to see like to what happened why is he going to
that extent like you know because the the way they come close close and C to I want
that shot actually then when I saw in the edit it's not working then I use the casing
shot yeah so the sh value so I just use that kissing shot and next when the
music goes High I use that tracking shot then when I explained to ranir and trp
also I said like it will look like a painting it will not look like it did look like a painting actually because it's almost like a still life you they
they're not moving at all yeah only the cigarette smoke is moving like that yeah it was a deliberate it's like they're
lost just to give a feeling that you know suddenly what happened what is this
new love story and from there within no time I want to get to a point where she'll open the
backstory so when he says like I knew the day one that you are this then there's a question that he
would have threatened her but knowing the fact if you threaten she'll not open yeah so you I want to you have to seduce
yeah I thought like you you gone to that level also that okay I'll get this out
so yeah it is it is actually layered very deep it will be nice to see in the part two Park yeah I think yeah because
yeah yeah because because when you see if you have you noticed when she says now go and kill
her she's always saying you murdered so many people now she's [Music]
going and I felt even the bootlicking scene also I didn't want to piss
somebody or I didn't do it to irritate somebody it's like I felt I knew that you're a mole I knew that you have come
here to do something wrong to me but to kitabi how much of acting you had I felt
there is one little side of ranay he you know there's a moment yeah you
can't say you're fully acting there's a moment of you know see she thought she'll cheat you but she gave up but you
know that she came to cheat you but you are double cheating her you know and at one point you also as a man you
understood that she's really giving it that you know that warmth or whatever you know so there there is a mild
connection which he doesn't want to accept in front of the wife maybe he also hates the fact that he got a little
connected with Zoya so that's why when she opened up why did you say that lick
my shoe because she said I really love you and I can't handle your hatred I saw
how much you love your father you
know because I love you so much AA then uh lick my shoe because why he wants to
prove because I that's a very fine line showing that you also got connected yeah
that's why you are trying to test her I don't know how many people understood that right but most of them thought oh
God he's asking her to lick the shoe it's not point is not that point is unknowingly you connected you enter
into a very dark world now it's going to screw you up completely that's what I want to show but whatever it is we'll
see in the part two but this is a nice planting which I thought it's a very fine way to do it right but most of them
thought about the boot looking only they never thought about the emotion it's for me it was the equivalent of like yeah
you love me okay jump out of that window yeah you know like do something extreme like like uh because at that moment he's
like he's pissed off that she's saying oh I love you still whatever it is after doing all this and he's like this is an
extreme he's because he takes his leg away when she comes so he takes his leg away so it's like it's not like he
really wanted but it's like more like saying okay if you really love me jump out of the window or you know some some some random thing that's yeah it's a
test or rather he's kind of that irritated that that that moment has come about yeah yeah that's why he'll tell to
his cousin s Pana yeah that's that's a warning that warning is coming out of
you see no matter what you have a feeling that because of you I found my
uh you know uh Destiny yeah yeah so I know know where to go and what to do so
it's that's why I think he'll say I can't kill her right so she why you love her so that became more complicated
there right so do you see ranv as a misogynistic person see actually I don't
know most of the misogyny is disrespect to women right the actual definition of
is that right to name even Kabir Singh even animal even me as a person I always
feel like my picture production name is badali picture I know why people think that I is people not too many only this
15 20 Jokers but it's a wrong wrong word to use on Kabir and animal you know what
what do you think I want to ask you right you think it's a misogynistic character Kabir Singh or Arjuna or this
guy no I'll tell you what I I feel right see the thing is because the characters are so overheated and because the world
is so overheated everything is so extreme I I I wouldn't apply the normal
rules of the world to this world right see for example in this movie uh he says
I slap you he she she says if you slap me I'll slap you right back or something like that you know like like kind of a
thing by the way did that line come about because you wanted to no no no it came here he didn't want to address your
because I I thought like she she she's a girl I'll slap you yeah but I'll slap you first yeah so I'm I'm like see
because the characters are so extreme uh for me in your films the rules of the normal world don't
apply really and that's what's good about it because it's like see for example if you read books like uh like
wding heights and all those Gothic novels right it's this passion that is so like overpowering and all those kinds
of stuff that it's like those people don't really they'll seem like to others they will seem like mad people but only
they will know what that that passion or whatever that that thing is so for me
it's like it's like literally like watching through a glass wall people who
look like us but behave in this very passionate intense Manner and for me
what also like I know I get into a lot of discussions about this where people disagree with me but where I see this is
your Heroes always end up paying for their mistakes whether it's Arjun Rd he
loses the girl and uh he ends up messing up his career he's forced to accept his
mistake uh he goes through a long period of self-reflection self-realization things on things like that he gets to
the a bottom of a pit because he loses is that girl it's like and then he has to lift himself up again and make
himself worthy of getting her it's only after he tells the medical board that
yes no I'm not going to take a refuge in a lie I'm going to admit that I did a mistake because enough is enough it's
only then that after that that he meets prti till then he's not meeting prti like like when he's still in that
horrible I'm a rock star face it's only after he realizes mistakes that he's meeting pry this is how at least I I see
it right and everybody's probably seeing it differently yeah similarly here at the end for all the things that he does
his father is still going to die his wife goes away it's like he loses his uh
hearing he's like it's not like like they pay for whatever like there's a
kind of Redemptive aspect right so for me not Redemptive that's a wrong word but what I'm trying to say is that so I
don't see it as a uh I see it has these characters in this particular movie and
uh I guess it also has to do with how people see movies because some people see movies as okay if you see this movie
then it impacts people outside in society uh I see it as this is a story
being told within this Frame and I have to enter that world to understand those
characters that's as simple as that yeah I I don't know I know that that a lot of people are going to find a problem with
what I just said but that's that's the way I process F but this too much of
analyzing and scrutinizing films started off late right past 10 years before I
don't know but I think it's I think it started slowly but don't you think it's a good thing because it's like you get to hear different sides see yeah get to
hearing different sides is different but completely without knowing the context out of context May s few things you see
and see see I I've heard somebody saying like now he's the hero of the film
asking a girl to makes a girl to lick his shoes that's a wrong because he
never made her to lick yeah yeah yeah and even when you know when she you know
the pregnant woman is threatening her that he's going to shoot so all that they say it in a very different context
but the context of the film is different yeah I'm talking about that having a conversation you know people having a
different point of view is always great yeah because it is affecting the whole idea of art art up discuss but I think
it's it's it's good because it's like see I see it this way somebody else sees it some other way somebody else sees it
some other way and I think like that that way that's fine but I feel that that's totally fine because because the
main uh aim of the art is Art will definitely upset people which my understanding of it is but playing a
different context is different now because having a different point of view criticizing I love people criticize it
because okay you understood this way but interpreting in a wrong way is my problem so that's that's a see if you
don't see the movie and you comment about it or then that's the problem definitely that's a that's a I think
it's okay to not like a movie but at least watch it properly and understand and then dislike it or whatever it like
yesterday we spoke thinking that nobody talks about the craft because I've seen
people this growing numbers only talking about the how he's misbehaving with the
women and the your review is over I mean like this is they're taking it too personal maybe because I'm I watch
so many violent films I didn't find animal particularly violent exactly what
kind of world Cinema we see the dark films we see yeah it's like because I've seen
very very dark disturbing viol like if you see saw uh or all those movies those are like those mess you up for days this
is not a old boy old boy yeah this is not I for me at least but then again you know for somebody who Maybe Who has not
seen those films this is a violent film I think it's also the exposure and and other things no they're exposed I don't
know but only they are very particular when it comes to Indian film because I've seen people talking reviewing great
things about Joker and wolf of the Wall Street what I feel very funny is I can understand random people talking about
it even reviewers are talking about it okay I've I've seen people in the industry who are actors you know the
directors you know attacking other persons uh a film it's very I mean I'd like to know
first yeah you have proved people wrong by saying by making the biggest box off
his successes right but why does this bother you so much no that's what I'm saying see I'll tell you my point is
like why can't you just say okay they're not understanding the movie The Way I intended it and that I can say to a
person who saying like I didn't like the film right but you are misinterpreting the film is there some part of you that
says I want people to kind of really understand where I'm coming from no I'm saying like if you don't understand also
like see the everybody takes it in a very different way it's it's hugely populated country right but I'm saying
like you belong to the film industry and not understanding this is like I feel you wantedly doing this right because I
I see that that this is deeply bothering you in some way does this like affect your writing for instance do you do you
not at all not at all you think it affected I'm asking you yeah I I don't I don't think so right yeah because when
you're when I'm seeing animal I'm seeing a very free mind yeah yeah yeah yeah like I'm not seeing somebody putting
boundaries and like like I'm seeing a very free mind when I see the screenplay of animal yeah so but that's good yeah
yeah yeah that's good yeah it's always good yeah to have a free mind when you write and make films it's not like yeah there is one part of this film that was
very interesting among many other parts was which is like when he addresses the workers at the factory yeah which is
actually the one place where he's letting go of of or rather like the fury
that has been building up inside him that's exploding at that point to the workers of his Factory yes so what made
you say this is the point that this emotion should come out rather than
maybe at home or maybe with his brother-in-law or maybe with with whatever else a and why did you name the
factory swastic steals because uh auspiciously uh you know it's a very
auspicious title we always do this in our Puja also every time in G that remained in me and I
found it's very nice rhyming altic Ste and that opening thing I always wanted
to put this Factory thing at the furnace right side my there's a lot of furnace
are there like huge Factory and there a lot of crowd than what you see now but it didn't happen because we saw the
furnace but they didn't allow us to go there and do it's too much of heat also actually to have it from a different
distance also didn't let it happen because you have to get the crowd it's tough to control crowd at the furnace
anything can go wrong so we had we got we got a kind of a studio kind of a
thing and we multiplied the crowd and did that and I felt the moment he came
and I didn't want him to behave shout throw things and what has happened instead I want to keep quiet I just want
him to meet the father right because the once he saw the way they was walking and the camera is charging onto anlg I
thought there's a nice you know there's a gap which is getting filled after a long time after that he comes out and I
I deliberately wanted I want his rage to come out through Speech cuz two things are happening one he's motivating them
to go back to your job promising them that I'm going to get my father after 3 months here and throwing the promise to
the even the media is covering it in a way so I thought like four five things are happening in one it's a nice thing
to happen in any screenplay because every time you have to address four different things in world four different scenes our length it's already 3 hour 30
minutes so so that's that's the main thing yeah I kept length also in mind I thought like whatever rage and
everything the rage is coming out in the factory with the furnace in the side it's very symbolically shot I imagine
that way but I didn't get the furn but still it worked and it's also there was a certain uh thing about the Loyalty of
the workers yeah three generations is saying about yeah yeah so that was coming across really well that that's
they hting and all that yeah that they're all like like it's almost like a like a
rally you know that he's that he's kind of kind of a thing and I think what makes it scene really human is that from
that almost like a like that big political speech kind of a thing you cut
to the thing on TV and you show Anil Kapoor's face he's like again like what
is this guy doing or what is he saying and that makes it very human because from a very powerful thing you're you're
seeing now the other other side it's like like like why can't this guy just be like regular and yeah there's one
line actually uh because I didn't want it to shoot like a live I wanted to shoot like it has already happened he's
watching the TV and mang comes and he says I just wanted to say like look at
him he is actually the real successor I want to use that but I thought like there's no
need I thought like I'll not get that so and anyways it's live also so I thought like I you know opted out but uh
I don't know whether you noticed it's like I felt he maybe he's a capable guy maybe he's a real successor of you know
the swastic steel or whatever Empire he has he has a leadership qualities right
more importantly that's a very alpha male scene yeah yeah yeah motivating and all
that and for him to see like he's in us from past 8 years he's just landed yesterday morning morning and
next day he's in the factory he's like you know it's it's not easy to talk like
that you know that he is surprised also and at the same time he's feared also he's getting
scared and there's a dialog actually I I removed that also there's
no need kah want straight show into the fields he going to Punjab so yeah at the
end you said Animal Park yeah uh what was that that that name that name how
did it come I thought like you know know everybody there's bunch of animals now it's not only one or two yeah so it's
it's it's a Warfare now right so so it's a kind of mahabarata now between brothers and cousins and all that right
right did that scene at the airport again the fight between uh the cousins
that is abar and ran VI it looks like one of those National Geographic
documentaries where you know some two animals are are fighting for like our together like they're just going on and
on and on and on and and like there's no kind of until one of them kills the other they're just going to keep fighting kind of a thing is is that
again something that you that you had in mind is yeah because because in the in the usual fight even when you narrate it
to the stand Master also they'll say Sir this is open ground there's nothing to
throw on each other because they they always want some properties to throw on each other so it's it's there's nothing
other than the first fight you have to punch it till somebody dies and both are deliberately saying we don't want
weapons it's it's quite a bit of challenge also for the choreographer to create that right so we got that's why
we we constantly getting ideas of smoking and you know opening the zip and all that having conversation in between
so you know in our Mahabharat and puranas they say know that how much ever
your opponent is cruel you have to give him last one last chance yeah so I thought like maybe he'll ask him because
Grandfather said leave him so he he thought like maybe he'll just take a word from him because I always feel like
um you know my characters always in the film always respect the you know enemy
also opponent also they give equal respect because even in Arjun this is what again I noticed even Arjun he ask
him promise me that you're not going to come back to my girl again then he'll say like you know okay I promise you
this is that Holy scene right that Holy scene so I thought I don't know this is also I noticed after the release
actually I'm comparing what it so he say like you know promise me that you'll not come back again cuz I didn't spend one
day proper day and grandfather said that we are brothers now maybe you also touched you know you
got felt like finally you know your brothers are coming towards you and he's
grandfather clearly says yeah that's a fact actually yeah is
animal part going to be your next film next is uh spirit Spirit yeah that's
that's and uh but you're going to kind of keep working working on on this as
well like animal park no I'll I'll I'll after that I'll work because I don't believe in writers room and all that
multiple writer I write my own stuff I never I mean worked with co-writers I
don't know how that will work I I'll try one day but uh but in this film The there are two writers credited along
with you right oh the screenplay it's a screen scen but story you you screen play because I always discuss with my
brother yeah so is there any point where any of the actors run be or Rika or any
of the actors said why is this happening or what is happening here or or kind of a thing because you know when we watch
the finished product everything is is kind of clear but when you're in it and
when you're making it there may be things that are not because your shoot is always out of syn you're not shooting
in a in order or whatever it is is there any point that that no actually good
that you bought because yesterday night only we were discussing with my ads and my brother there's not even one single
moment in the film in the narration especially with ranir that uh he he
questioned the thought of the film that uh s why do you think this is coming now I don't think so this should this is
right he always tried to you know GAE and understand where this energy is
coming from or why this scene is coming he's always I think there's a director inside him also so because he never uh
uh asked me saying that I don't think so this is going to work like that he always believed in every because I used
to ask him R everything and you are liking is everything okay I'm I'm I was getting doubt on
myself why why is he liking everything why is he not saying anything he I have problem in this problem in that he used
to say like s everything unit is superb it is it is so new so real I never heard
of so it's like you know you know while making only you feel that confidence like you know actor who is so senior he
16 fil old is finding everything new that means story you know is Spirit
going to be another Wild free film I don't know let's see yeah but
I'll be free while writing I I don't uh think about how it has been criticized I think that that should not come because
it will completely deviate from your originality so right now this also means
that you can only choose certain actors with certain image for your movie is
that because maybe not everybody will fit into this world right because some of them might have very like because one
one thing that I read was you're trying to make a love story with Nani no I just
yeah no I wanted to narrate him long back in 2010 but I can't imagine you making a Nani type of love story because
that's a very different Zone yeah yeah yeah but is that something that you had in mind no this is long time back before
my debut I wanted to narrate a story by then Nani was not the same Nani today he was also just just starting new right so
that's a different story that's a different story okay is it true that that for the kind of the zone that
you're interested in the the place or the characters that you're interested in you'll only be able to work with certain
actors with a certain kind of image no nothing like that because but if you see animal it is you you you'll not think
you know andir will fit into this right you know because uh actually that's true because yeah yeah because when he said
yes and when he started getting into the treatment of the scenes elaborating the
scenes it became customized for him because I know he's going to play now
usually what happens is you write then you pitch right this happened in a way that you pitched the idea he liked it and you started getting into the scenes
or t made can give me an example of how you tailored a scene for unbe uh for example uh you know the the factory
scene the walk you know uh you know the simple promise of putting hand like that and turning and you know saying it he he
had his own style of doing it and obviously I added few things and he was
very much ready to adapt into whatever new thing which is coming even the way
he smoking he putting in hand that everything he took it very organically like it was never like I'm pasting it on
him you know it it uh and he did it very effortlessly which is no but I'm asking like is there a scene that that that you
wrote specifically saying I know ranir is going to do the scene so I'm going to write it this way but for example you
know the way he comes in Converses if because it is ranir uh to ganali yeah yeah you're
feeling it more like that even even the action part even the you know viness in
the character because of R R's personal vulnerability helped a lot for this character right you know because it's
it's very unusual for example if this is a story imagine I didn't meet ranir for
the line I wrote the story and when when if I pitched it to you uh you would
always imagined uh a mass hero in this you know you would never
imagined actor from Sanju or jawani diwani will fit into this because I
always noticed in Rockstar and in few scenes where I used to see a great rage
in his eyes right I always used to find this is Action Hero eyes maybe he's doing some romcom you're not feeling it
but when you place him he'll be great this is my personal feeling whenever I saw his films there were few bits and
pieces that they're coming out popping out like hey P the action hero you know it was like that for me so it it worked
I mean yeah yeah all the best for spirit thank you so much congratulations on the
big success of animal thank you and uh I think it's kind of done better than what you expected right yes yes yeah yeah are
you the kind of writer who who also because you said that certain things that you do for shock like for example
cutting from the plane to the car kind of a thing you do keep the audience in mind while you're writing yes yes yes
that's something that you yes that you do that so and I always even in the scenes when I reread it and when I uh
sleep over it I always feel that like we said it in the yesterday interview like I always feel like my my my feeling is
directly uh proportional to the gallery I always feel till now three films it worked let's see for the further films
but I always feel nice yeah so cool all the best for
spirit and thank you so much for the session thank you so much had fun great fun
