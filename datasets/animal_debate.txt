so good evening this is the big debate of having today when a filmmaker makes a film
responsibility for influencing young people and for messaging and for the morality that is putting out or within
sort of framework of freedom of speech and expression the we all enjoy in this country should filmmakers be allowed to make whatever
now to begin with the sensor board or the person controls actually does a category where it is it ok
were talking about the film animals what is decided that you should only
he has decided to make perhaps the most violent film
glorification of miscellaneous ideas the violence for violence and the impact that it will
who tends to relieve mimic and sort of follow what Bollywood shows that having this conversation and we have
understand what all of this means in terms of the impact on youth to begin with my
about films and you know the portrayal of women the portrayal of
the language used and this kind of misogyny that gets glorified some very happy she had the time to join us KV Sridhar or poses is commonly known for those of
is a vector and at advertising and messaging with a very modern outlook on what's happening in our society
Supreme Court and I am really happy that you agree decided to join us because there's a legal point of view here as well freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental
India and with some exceptions so you want to understand everything in this film is really allowed within that Framework co-founder
just be a man who talks about what it is like you know to be a man and what the ex
in that space technical deals with only thank you all of you for joining us
start the jumping of point of what the law allows us film
he walks into a high school because he feels
send a message the freedom of speech and expression in the current framework of part
when a freedom of speech has to mean anything it is freedom of speech or what you do not want to hear
you do not want to see popular speech requires no protection it is unpopular speech
you dislike but you still have to allow and hear the Framework as far as princess concerned is set by the sensor board
the sensor board looks at whatever aspects under censorship court and then certifies films for release
you cannot require that the sensor board also be a sensor of people's morals or messages that go out on film
then you are it's a thin end of the witch supposing the sense of Bob says that you know this is not a proposition that the public
should be subjected to or will accept the sense of what is not a sensor of public place
so if a filmmaker gets his film certified by the sense about and it is exhibited in accordance with that their ends the De
you are of course free to criticize the film yes that's also freedom of speech you are free not to view the film all
those things come and you are even free to protest outside the theatre as far as the film is concerned without resorting to violence that two is freedom
approach the court saying I find this film to violence you should not be sure
possibly challenge the certification by the sensor board saying that look at the sensor board has set out this particular norms
and ignore them then that's a pure administrative block question that if you set out the law and you do not follow the law then follow the law
what is the sensor board having applied the law then certify the film then you can't say that you know it does not
a fall within my preferred taste of this is not how it should be allowed just let me conclude by giving you one example
come up in The Bandit Queen if you remember the film there was a very violent rape of fulan Devi which was shown
but that was integral to the Phoolan Devi story and you could not have had that film
that impact without that website on the screen as it was
possibly that short could have been edited by the director or could have
another way or shown in another way but that is the director's vision it is the vision of the
creative unique and love to stand by the supreme court itself
start with you what
the problem is not the violence the problem is not even the misogyny the problem is not the story the problem
the problem is the the justification of of things right that we
violence it's not like this is the first time we've seen a human head being
open bionex it's fine you know that kind of stuff whoever wants to tell the story tells the story the way they want to tell it and the conversation is in about weather
should be allowed to make a certain kind of famous should not be allowed to make a certain kind of film we live in a free country that like if we start going down that road it's a slippery slope you can
tell filmmakers what kind of films they can or cannot make what this conversation is about is the larger discourse
the film and the pushback criticism of the film receives it's like there is a status quo that we must adhere to that this is a movie star and these
and on the screen
yeah so anywhere bottle fake comes back I can just carry on talking about animal
back the question is not about whether Sandeep should be around allowed to make this film as a Ranbir should be acting in such a film the question
the case with which the film is made and the conversation in the criticism is about what the film is propagating with the film is forgiving of
what the film is the you meant to delete this always a way you know you can you can see it in the in the conversation with the film before it even released
the intention with which you know this story has been put out the words
watch Rambo first experience
which is already saw the Joker which was
how is that different from this pops in question to you do you see a problem with animal or are you of the view that you know like it
no I don't have a problem because creative people have free to express you know tell stories it is no fun
for No brainer if you were to not include a twist in the character correct it's all about characterisation if you
actually look at the family with one liner relationship between the sun and the father which is boring nobody would go to theatres if you actually say another complexity of the character
and the wave in portrait and that is that is what makes today stories means a biopic from
why today now you just take the complex characters and then you tell a small narrative it's not a story with small event but you traumatized every
find the trend of actually lack of story lack of insight lack of something else in
and then hiding behind too much of violence in a too much of gorgeous
is appropriate it's fine you know as Sanjay said you know if it is that is serious enough to be shown to the
to get the story and then to get the emotions find the two things morally and then legally legally they are fine you know
the expert tab spoken and only Kelly nobody can do anything but morally every story writer in a when they face with a white paper taken write
story with they want to write and this is what I am a member of asking board self governance in a leaving
creative people who I am writing the stories to their imagination and then to their own value systems what kind of story you want to write and then how do you want to
play the story if you look at it started with Wasseypur but Wasseypur did not have as Gori details as it has
on ott but you know somewhere another line needs to be drawn because all the content today is all
I have no problem in a Torrent and also that films which has got violence but but it is just a competition that who
I can chop five fingers and then blood stream in a comes out as 5 fountains we were quite Complex when we saw somebody chop
blood is Losing out of that now it's a matter of how many organs you you chopped in how many streams of blood it will come out
we used to have a horror Jordan completely when we were young you know whether it is correct and then you go and then see this Gori think of
screenshot but you know there is something you know which we all do when we actually
something which influences millions of people and then we think twice what do you want to put and what you don't want to put
Nikhil Nikhil can you tell me the gift of a lot about the game it's the messaging that we send out it's what we glorify as acceptable behaviour
when this person says oh you have the hips to bear and Alpha I will marry you or
do you know earlier the Alfaaz would go out and hunt in the women would look after the children and they would just marry more Alfaz and have more Alpha what is
from a social point of view why is that problematic in your opinion add to this point I feel
anyone should be allowed to make any film that they want right because as Sujata said and as Mr Sanjay and everyone's been saying over here the moment we start police
what films can you cannot be made then we are in a dangerous society in any case there are people who file FIR in our country against the things that
I don't like in movies so you might have a Bombay begums which is the series where you know they have shown a teenager you know experimenting
Arun Jaitley and someone find the case against that under posco and what do you say to this right and this is just one case I can many
cases so I don't think that the right way of looking at any film is to a sensor or to say that you know this
every film is valid as an expression of the filmmaker that is making it and the story that they want to say it is the lens that it comes down to and the lens should
scene in not just the context of what the film represents but also in the context of where we are in a as a culture where we are as a society
recently that said that the difference between a film about a toxic character and a toxic film is the intent of the filmmaker I haven't seen
animal I don't have like unlike Sucharita I don't have the burden of having to watch it releases and I can choose not to watch a film
I don't think represents a kind of value system that I want to see on screen having said that I know that the filmmaker himself Sandeep Reddy has multiple Times
you know in interviews and spoken about that the fact that the syllabus and answer to his pretext this film is made to make a point this film is made to Trigger
me to be provocative and when you are doing when you show casing something on screen just to make a point to people who
I like you and that point is being made through misogyny and that point is being made through excessive violence if that point is being made through a certain value system that tries to
showcase that there is a certain kind of a man that is cool to watch it's not that the film again you know and he is playing with us right leg because he is called
so the fact is that is there is a film where the person the character in it is supposed to animalistic at the same time the film also has really cool music it has
is banking background music that I you know this is great soundtrack is it that it has any time that there is something problematic that is being shown on screen it is
shown through a really cool soundtrack which almost goes on to say that you must like this is this moment that you must almost cla
that this is not a animal movement or a villain moment but a hero moment and then I keep hearing from everyone who is gone on to theatres to watch this film that they were SHO
Aur Baby possibly unsuppressed that people are clapping when a misogynistic line is being said or their clapping when something terrible happens on screen or they laughing at
and that's the problem with with a film like this side it is the intent of the filmmaker it is there it is the lens with which this film is being made and it is being done only to showcase
I can do this and and you can't do anything about it because if you do something up if you complain about it that I can point to all the students speak book
that you are made and I can say why is this ok and why is this not ok and that's where we are at and we need to kind of view all of these films on the lens of unfortunately how
consumed by society that anyway at this point of time believes that you know we are still a very patriarchal Nation whistle a nation that were a lot of this gender
are being told that being Alpha is actually the right way of being not being an ideal man really means being a Bully sometimes being an angry man sometimes
treating the women in your lives with any way that you possibly can and do it is a huge hero for a lot of people and not just outside in the world also in India so in a social
expect that should be the making films like this just to make a provocative point just to showcase that just to Trigger a people who want to see a certain kind of value system in the
around is not in the films I think that's the issue that were dealing with this is really important point a lot of people might not know that you know back
it would be the soundtrack that could inform you as the audience it's not time to feel that right so what
soundtrack informs you that this is something to celebrate but going back to what he said which is the director of the film animal had said very clearly that oh you
this is violent after Kabir Singh I will show you what a violet film release the next one should be supervised as
that was in response to your review were you said that Kabir Singh was really violin tell us what happened did you bring the song
I am not going to give myself credit ki maine please please
that that is a conversation that if someone wants to have in the comment section by all means go ahead and have it I would not in my wildest dreams have the friction
you know lack of self Awareness to be learning
having said that Jo Meri review Hai Jo Mera critical analysis
it could be my Instagram post it could be my review on YouTube any conversations that I'm having a journalist like yourself or other women it is you know
going out in saying that you should not look at a piece of art through your own morality don't impose your own morality on someone else's Pizza Hut you always impose your own morality on peace on
yeah it could be any format of art it could be a painting a painting will move you because of what is inside you not just because what is in the in the in the on the Canvas
similarly a film will activate your emotion because of what is already inside you so what I have spoken about the film is what
violence is one thing but what is who is the violence being committed upon and is the are those acts of violence being justified as heroic or
to show a the craft of action choreography is not a problem action choreography is great it's a very skillful thing for a filmmaker and
coordinates to achieve on screen but it's the larger picture of it when you look at it as a painting when you take it take five steps back when you sit and that museum when
time looking at it what it works within you what it works within me is a very feminist response because that's just who I am as a person and that's what who all of us should be but you know
it is not about Kisi Ne Kaise banaa Diya how Dairy make something like that or how does she say what she said it's about
cinema is so Complex it is such a complex art form because it's called visuals it's audio it's got edit it's got music it's got dance it got it all the other art forms are
cast in a in one single frame and every second is 24 frames we need have more conversations around what what it means
more critical conversations in my general are required in our country
does the legal Framework also and there is the moral responsibility because Bollywood
what is the effectively can we say a mirror to society I am so when we are making films where it shows a young person walking
school with the gun is there a risk in your mind you know that we might be encouraging gun while is because we are looking across the world at another
school is a real problem should they be in your opinion of moral responsibility on filmmakers
is that something I should be doing should I be encouraging that filmmakers they are not more or less
not religious leader so each one comes with his own set of morals you may make a very violent film and yet have
the moral of the film could very well be that violence doesn't work do they of a
when I think that two is a slippery slope because
the courts have also at the same time argued that bollywood superstars who win dose products
also people on the on on Instagram who are influences when does product should be held to some extent responsible for the quality of water resources
don't just be do it with impurity between manufacturing the time does that level of influence then
that is a tricky question let me let me put it this way
when you endorse or influence somebody else's product then innocence
you are taking a certain ownership of it when you are putting your own workout for the
call to judge your essentially saying judge me this is not a message
this is my particular vision of of the way that I tell the story I have submit supposing I am not for instance forget films
I write a very very violent book now as long as it does not fall within an
to violence or any of the Other prohibited sections I am still able to I should be able to publish textbook so
somebody submits his film his book or maybe even a painting for the judgement of the public he or
does not tell the public that look you have to follow it this is a vision that I am communic
you use your own judgement I think that is that's where I join issue with suitable on the guest
there are people with all kinds of Jesus and when you you are submitting your heart
your point of view to the public say that this is my guess I know that some of you are going to hate it and that's what the director said
you may hate it you may get triggered but this is within the law this is my point of you
if you like it and you pay and you pay to come into the movie theatre and and was it so be it
if you don't like it but you still come to the movie theatre to think about it so be it my duty is to say
vision is possible and that is the vision that I am communicating I don't think that
is the further responsibility legally for any particular possibility
response to that everyone has a gas and everyone sweet potatoes are absolutely everybody will put that is out because if you are the
product your creating any art form it could be if it doesn't have your case then what is it you are not manufacturing it in a factory every song every poem every
every film it comes from a human person from a human pointer view from their own lens on humanity to get legality is not
think that I would debate at all it can't be illegal to make films again because like Taneja was saying a few minutes ago if you
pretty this was so much legality that gets involved when filmmakers try to express their creative vision through their craft is per FIR Ho Gaya isko Pakistan
use June Mein To Ham Ja hi Nahin Sakte Hain gas to hoga hoga sabka and like mister
it's like an advertisement isn't it what are actors doing act as a marketing the film actors actors are agreeing to be a part of the film actors are agreeing to the message of the film that's why they are
when big movie starts say that I'm not always soda drinks because they are not good for your body and it's not something that we active
drink or consume in our lives we will not endorse it similar isn't it act as are also endorsing value proposition of the
the values of the film that they are participants in they cannot be separated from the film saying someone else's vision.com
can I just make one distinction that when a sports person endorses a fizzy
aur Pan parago something like that then that is a product with somebody else is made which has been
by the market are you know about the and then you are endorsing it despite everything often when a films film actor
science of project is types of the script is a character that he has to enact but the ultimate vision
how it comes out the gas there is very little kind of control that the actors themselves have
responsibility as such would be more likely to be that of the producer as well as the director very often
as a lawyer I get a brief last minute all that all that look at is what is the
possible argument that I can make or what is the best possible performance I can give I am not necessarily endorsing the
the character of the climate change
now 34 your projects and especially the lead male actor on the film has it tremendous amount of agency
on how his portrait what he looks like what he says what that
a film is not a new flavour that you be like I don't know how this flavour taste films have flavours and those flavours are tried and tested
human stories and every actor who is getting script to say that they don't understand how the script is portraying
directors to infantilize the actors and take away the responsibility from them so it is degree with that politely
understand the character but how would the entire story gel together it's very unlikely I mean Amjad Khan as Gabbar Singh
play let's take it would be a different Gabbar Singh from what was originally slated for that character
would have been what what he has would you have had agency over how
ultimate product came over shown itself at two separate index there was one ending
use Jamane ka Bollywood Hindustani ka Bollywood completely different actor
final sign of if I am not mistaken on almost everything especially the male actors but anyone wants to pops you want to take that
I mean the comparisons were slightly different between actors working in a film versus models or celeb
you are endorsing product and I mean one comparison I totally agree with Sanjay please you very well know
and what the product is and if it is legally allowed to be sold and marketed there is no legal issues you sign a correct
if you the trouble it comes if you don't understand the legalities of it and then you flaunt and then you put something without a thing saying that you are endorsing
without people knowing that you as a celebrity paid celebrity and that's where you are going to sleep the people and Advertising lot of this influence
will fall into that misleading people as if you personally and endorsing while you are taking money to say the product is good so therefore you know
different comparison as far as film seconds and everyone knows that where the film is headed what kind of film
will be made at least the lead actress will not know too much about in a half the film is going to be treated and nobody takes away
legality or the right of a director or a writer a story writer or an actor to express himself freely in that particular
if it is differently wide and then you are portraying his life and he will do all the wild things which because he is different
where it gets affected is is if the viewer does not know that he is not normal human being is differently
currently why it is a psychopath so as long as people get to know that what the plot is then they will take the right moral out of that that is
film you will know that is a hero or what is done is good or bad the second
legally there is absolutely nothing you cannot ask anybody to stop expressing themselves but there is something called
morality in which you put filters as creative people we always put that filter because when you are starting with an idea in a you know how realistically want to me how
you wanted to make how hyperbolic you know you can make and then can you want to take it to a success level in a by taking the mail
protagonist in a certain way so all the options are available in your head before writing a script you exercise which
is correct to your own conscience in advertising we do what is right for the brand here we have to exercise what is right
my own conscious you know what is the kind of story which I want to tell people and then influence people with my stories so that is where the filter
applied by creative people themselves in a nobody can force or info enforce them to to have that filter later or to crucify them
that is only thing you know the greater person interview that Aamir Khan give
many years ago that is now doing the rounds in which he is effectively said that he believes that using the violin so sex extensively
indicates to a lack of talent and creativity on the part of director because these are the two basic emotions is very easy you know to use that but
Complex emotional ideas to build Complex characters is far more difficult and it's when someone legs creativity that they Resorts to using violence and
these are all cliches and low hanging fruits which you Resort to all the films in all the
based on either hyperbolic or a conflict now what is the conflict which is happening how do I resolve it your intelligence lies in picking the resolution
how are you resolve that is where this entire thing with you take you want
the closing point is that the law recognises that it has limitations and if
is within the law you cannot necessarily apply the same moral standard to everyone people have different morals
long as you do not seek to possibly impose your morals on anybody
aur you know summer manipulate the models I think I think
you should allow people their full say thank you very much pray for having me thank you
really interesting sort of energy when she talked about sports people not endorsing physically right
video of the footballer Ronaldo moving on the fizzy drinks away from him in a Press Conference drink water
legal rights to do so it's the moral stand
the message you want to send out everyone associated with a film like this is choosing actively to be part of that
responding to the American statement of this is the lowest hanging fruit pops also agreed that people so I was saying then that the 60
probably bigger than that of the largest open
Ranbir Kapoor 61 crore on the first day second biggest opening of the year after Pathan biggest for the
so it's done really well because of the slogan
I don't know if this is honestly low hanging fruit because Aamir himself did Ghajini and you obviously made the statement much before that and
make that statement now stands today as is relationship all other relationship with Cinemas stands today where announced a film with Sunny Deol right
Gadar 2 will make a statement of absolutely and you know the thing is that if you look at also I mean I don't want to again give my judgement on
Sandeep Vanga Reddy's art but at least from the films that have seen weather it is Kill Bill or whether it is the Raid you know the balance was craft it wasn't and it
it was both it and it serve the purpose there was Puri there was an emotion emotional truth to it and you can't look at that and say that that is low hanging fruit right even
you know movies about sex sex lies in video type as an example by suitable is one of the best you know independent film was made in the 90s and all of
all of them have a purpose for existence and again I think in in the mind of the director of this film there is a purpose for the same to exist and within that film and within the universe
people violent yes the context of these people are violent yes and again you know when you look at individual seems like someone mentioned that I think switch on invention that
gun that was taken in a school of course about school shootings there is something called there is a film called we must talk
Kevin and there is a film called the duties which is about school shooting and which showed again these kids going and doing the silence but there was a justification and a purpose
how long this is my problem again with with films like this and you know I saw Kabir Singh ultimately because I need I wanted to be part of
before I give out an opinion and I possibly might watch animal also for research purposes but even in Kabir Singh right like the first time
when Shahid and his character Kabir comes into a college and puts his hand on a woman and says you know she is mine and you know to another guy who want
you know and there is a very cool banging soundtrack to it and you know and you know that the point of this is that this is a cool thing to do and the
movement your kind of trying to make everything look like a cool thing because that is the moral stands that you are taking that's the problem the fact that there is
today someone put out a thread that even when friends like that had come out at that point and this is after Shahrukh himself he said that it is you know he was a villain he did
justified ending he died side there was the bigger Hero has gone viral saying that you know when I play a bad guy
so I have to be very careful when I do bad guys and which is why when I play Bad Guys I don't disrespect women because I don't want men to look at me and feel like this is
actual thing to do but most other actors don't think like this and don't have these moral standard when it comes to friends because they are looking for the best part that they can get and
best part of the get to do terrible things you know and that evoke reactions they will do it so of course then we have agency of course rashmika's agency and you know while they might
the actresses in that field might have lesser agency than a Ranbir there was chosen but the recognise that this film is going to make that 61 crore opening because this is what unfortunately the audience wants
the reason they wanted is because the genuinely believe that this kind of Alpha men are cool and that's what we are having a discussion that they are
actually cool this is just a movie where you are UN mute
a little further away from the directors responsibility to the mirror that Bollywood shows our society
are we now a society and I want to also I believe the weave gotten to this point where we are watching a film like animal with someone's making a film like animal
because it is responding to the environment evolve based on the environment that there is the
let's consider the kind of content that gets put up on YouTube the kind of things I get said about women
about women in the comment section of world we live in where this the man who sits in his car and his girl is
gym sort of testosterone driven idea of a man
going back to the traditional idea of a man pushing fast this nonsense that you expected to soften up your expect us to do ghar ka kam
push back is not necess
is this a reflection of that push back in our society right now
it is it is at one point in time to be Metro sexual enough to be nice and then to to really respond to things
progressive way and then today men are threatened threatened at the very basic level
characters in women are their bosses they are seeing women in a behaving more than equals and then Sunday you know
you see not just this film in a last five years you know you see the list of films which have made it big from South North in a very well it is
Pushpa Vikram KGF rrr trailer Jawan Rana Gadar 2 Bhagwant Singh bhagwan Shri Kesari in
you look at all this films what are the reflection of the society I mean either you can mirror the society or you can INF
the choice is yours and then today's filmmakers and storytellers are choosing the path of file mirror the society and
is realistic is authentic based on facts because you are only showing the mirror but in this case you know they are not showing mirroring the society
there actually creating a hyperbolic story you know of one little aspect of something and then making a story out of it I mean while we can
creative people must have the freedom to express the way they wanted to express tell the stories and most of the stories are relevant to that you know era and then may not be
retrospective to a generation correct it may not be but having said all that in somewhere for the sake of
nothing to be different you know wanting to be original if people were start to think about in a how long this me to feel continue of this action
cruelty crudity in a raw material behaviour in the society and then killing people you know you
Hero fights because somebody kills his father he will go and then kill 5000 people in the movie if you keep a head count of that
so that's fine it's so it's fine to take revenge of 1 killing to 5000 people killing in that so all these
hyperbolic things in which are not really mirroring the society if you were to Mirror revenge and then you go to some extent to really make that happen and then you strug
you know it has a beautiful story line and it does you know it's a fiction but it does create the tension in the
and also the characters but you know this is one little overboard is my opinion while I am know that of anybody somebody else's work
I don't like I don't see but when lights people who create content must in a keep a filter of their own
consciousness in what they are creating research research
sort of online content creator who puts out really misogynist
Alpha mainly ideas and his watched by very very young boys who happened to follow him and watch him on the internet
treatment of the way of the girls their age is very different it is informed by those videos that they
for people in the comment section will read out some of the comment of speech is Paramount and nothing really
its impact on society will discussing societies impact that has led to a film Black animal
of that kind of content going up on a regular basis give me the long answer lead
which glorified a fictional freedom fighting movement which was fully violent and
imagining a different India right now what's your response to that
a look at where rrr went look at how much it travels look at what it did for not just SS Rajamouli but the actors the music at one and Oscar
where is into that if I because I was very heavily trolled for that review as well whatever you know you used to that kind of stuff your women's speaking on the internet
hello good morning but you know compared to what that film the impact of that film in the number of people it reaches in the number of masses it reaches compared to a channel that is just about it
1000 subscribers you it's not compatible you know so you putting everything together you it's not all content it is sometimes making the film somebody is making
Jupiter somebody is making regular Instagram reels everything has its own life everything has its own reach everything goes to different different places but that doesn't mean that you know feedback
giving on in my comment section if you don't like you don't watch it why why did you go to WhatsApp treating you badly you're going to say something you are not
it's not personally treating me badly but you know what I'm saying if if something bothers you you say something you could you could use your right of you know what I
freedom of speech in in that scenario and rotate Ke Kitne fans hai yaar bhai why you know aap ek bar Meri comment section mein
main padh rahi hun side mein simultaneously log kya bol rahe hain Feku Galiyan de rahe hain Ek Bandar
how does respectful imagine live the impunity with which men on the Internet operate don't make faces some but you telling I am sitting on
news channel with frequencies and what is telling me don't make faces live to my face so you know you know and to take nose who is making these videos for
Sandeep knows who is film is for they are not like silly gullible innocent innocent we know what the films are for
they are saying and then that's why would we have to say is also has to be that much calculated say why you and I are running are you know things on YouTube
our voice are decent are push back to the and rotates of the world no one will doing it on our own it's the
flute least as cultural commentators as women who feel like we have a voice and the vocabulary and the words in whatever language we choose to put that
I cannot rest if I don't do it and rotate
Bachelor of Commerce has the ability and the legal right to protect his opinion so does
and understanding of what messaging is going out from a film like animal and we talked about
to young boys were in high school right now
what in your mind is that message that's gonna right now and how much pressure of these boys going to be under 200
that's same sort of masculine energy I think I think when we spoke about low hanging
I think we were talking about violence and sex and I think provoking the society into a certain kind of
Alpha behaviour a certain kind of chest thumping You know angry Bully behaviour is the easiest thing to do
actually you know it's far more difficult and that's where you know films like those are tuffer to make and they get made very less because it's very
difficult to evoke empathy it is far more difficult to evoke a tears or humanity from cinema but it is for easier to Evo
a provocation or anger or irritability or misogyny because those are emotions Which are which actually don't with the base emotions they don't really
effort and and unfortunate thing is that because most filmmakers want to obviously also make money because this is a business you know
calling at heart but ultimately there is commerce involved and most producers are directors are always looking at the easy way out to make that kind of money versus taking the duffer
and saying something that is the truth and again I am not saying that this is not Sandeep Vanga reduce truth invited very much must very much must be and that is also
battery keeping to talk about but but I don't think I think it's a very if you don't take responsibility as well makers at as artists for the art that you putting out into
then you know what are you doing with the life I feel you know honestly like I feel like if you have not study it's science and not studied commerce and
your parents to get into the film industry to get into the media industry to call yourself and artist to write an original story to put your truth out into the world If you doing all of that ultimately to prov
you got triggered because I should one woman slapping sure I'll show another woman looking somebody is good now you tell me what what are you gonna say to me when you doing it for
you know that's the problem I feel you know with films like this and again I am not at all saying that you know Sandeep Reddy which should not be allowed to make the film that he wants to make make it
but I am saying that you know it's very easy for filmmakers like that two point out fingers and everybody else and say oh you got offended but then when we as a response talk about the fact that the reason
what the reason it is this tasteful according to us is this and not in the context of the character but in the context of what it is representing to the society at large then they also get off
getting triggered you know and but but when you get offended then your Army of you know supporters then you know latch on to us
angry actors you know college names are especially women Union and that's unfortunate truth to it right most women who are reviewing this film are being called you look at
who has always taken feminist dances I am saying even a senior you know journalist today and I've just been seeing their comment sections it's all just cross stuff
that you kind of almost give a you know free pass to people to be like this I acted like an animal so it is probably ok for you to as well but
and those are the things that if at any point of time as an example if at any point of time Sandeep anybody associ
the film would go out and actually say folks this is just a film this is being made only for entertainment this is about an animal this is about a character who behaves like an animal this is not
life don't ticket seriously don't endorsing the thing that happens in this film we are just made it for entertainment even if they say base level things like that I think
is there could be some sincerity to what they are trying to create but over here that's not the case in fact the opposite where it is being said that so what is exist and
Nikhil actors and filmmakers and writers should not have to go out and justify their films once the films around what they are saying
you shouldn't expect we can't expect this from anyone to be like no no I let me justify my movie this is my movie you make of it what you will always
sense of your accountability and and what you are what is the lens
if your length actually and you intend actually is not to create something that is just provocative for the sake of it and that is just for the sake of it you will actually say
we have created a bad character like everyone someone some people updating search about cause easy and taxi driver you know has created Killers of the flower
increase the one who actually stands up and says he was what stronger society he has been doing that repeatedly over the years his speaks about it all is about taking coun
for as creating you know a society where terrible things happen when cat is exist and and then also explains why they deserve the end that they deserve because we have
get on our reviews of specially female from critics are the idea is to of the internet to get us to shut up to not have
ideas to not express these opinions who is responsible for that who is responsible for hundreds and thousands of people working together to silence descending opinion
what is the responsibility of famous person
you give things to young people they will take it correct they had a rebellious place and then they know they want in
all the mails in the country of that age wanted to be like that it is like asking children that do you want chocolate and then you give them free chocola
eat it they will not the they will not know the replication of eating so many chocolates somewhere the mother
society is also like that correct and then the people who are influences need to have of course you give violent film you give success film you put
call rates in a film and then we will go and then watch it will be the meaning of 300 code 700 crores it will correct
but what are we really judging those films so it is not the money with the
it is not the impact which you are making and what kind of impact are you making and then you as an individual as an influencer as a writer and as
you are as an individual what impact are you making on people is it the impact if you want or you want to know some other impact you can you know you can
you can exaggerate things to make a point but you can't shy away from that exaggeration and then you know and then
what is the moral which people get its ok to go and then kill people it's OK to fight with my father and
thank you for coming that was made Bhumi Pednekar Riya Kapoor it is about a young woman not having a change in
trying many ways and many partners in order to when the film this is besides the point the
many reviewers on YouTube who were basically saying yah kya baat hai how can you teach young girls in the country that they should be going out and having
multiple partners and they should be looking for organisms that they should be because you are influencing young people and this is the message you are sending out with this kind of you know
this this is the kind of behaviour that young women should indulge in how is that different from the argument of making right now Anil Kapoor
you should leave it to individuals and their consciousness in our nothing you can do about it
kind of film I want to make I will make the kind of film you want to watch you go and then watch nobody else can judge and nobody can actually add intelligence
price in people who are at the power to use the power misuse the power and then guide the power in a different direction at the end of the day what do you want to be known for
there is something in which your conscious tell you that is it worth living the life which you have or you are not
that is what determines your own morality of choice in our comment section Sucharita who wants to know
ab actually because abhi 10:30 Gaye Mera intermittent fasting chal raha hai I am going to the kitchen I'm going to make myself some breakfast
because my face is not in the kitchen for many many years and it is unlikely that we are going to go
because we are here and we have opinions and just like Sandeep who can make a film like animal
ability to have an opinion on the show we can put it out on YouTube if you don't like it don't
rights if you don't like our opinion go away this is my channel
I am just I am just from this whole conversation taking this one thing away Mr Sridhar is called film critics mother's telling children don't
I will be your mother I think you need to add to I mean say the question that you ask about thank you for coming I think
eventually this discourse is important but we must be allowed to have this is course the issue with films like this is that they want to you know put a thund
to any discourse that tries to raise a single again you know which is the problem in itself right I have the discourse let us allow all the
around this to exist and engage with opinions as an artist don't engage with it from the lens of a troll you know if there is something that you find problem
talk about it and listen about it and try to come to a place where both of you with everybody can actually get to a common place where you can understand
we don't allow for that now if you talk about thank you for coming as a film of course women having agency in our country has not happened for a very very inner in the world has
such a long time that films that talk about women's Agencies are for fever and far more almost seen as inventive or innovative
films about men with guns have been
is oldest cinema themselves right so now what is the evolution of those films what are you doing different in a film about violence that has not been done 1000 times before and how
Sukhi Singh a certain kind of understanding of the world around you when you showcase this violence on screen you know I mean I am not going to again judge or ask the producer
like that to do what they want to do it as a film I am going to write something I am going to ensure that there is a positive version of a world I want to showcase because there is enough to
representations that have already you know that already out there and also see the said unfortunately most people are not critically sitting back and look
the nuances of why this was made of why this was not faith of whether or not this is an animalistic portrayal of whether or whether it is cool if you want to put a banking soundtrack when somebody is
always see when I go to theatres when there is a smoking scene you know you will have like smoking is injurious to health
killing people is injurious to health or not don't do it that's not something that the society that's ok
but bloodshed and and murders and misogyny is absolutely ok there is never going to be disclaimer around that and I feel like we are
allow us to be those disclaimer you choose to watch whatever when you want but recognise this film is not should not be an endorsement of society because if you think
and Pathan and also talk how much how feminism in in which where
Shahrukh Khan in both those friends almost is led by you know actresses over there in the first scene and pattern with because introduce Shahrukh is being saved by the women
when is completely cool with it he is like she is great at what she does by who am I to bother her and he just allows himself to be saved because he knows that she is great
in the same way as in Japan his army is of women and if you are not looking and taking a thing and if you not looking at that and saying that is the
I want to create then don't look at animal and say this is the society I want to create this is what an Alpha is like talking about
MD on one side there was animal on the same December which is about a real life sort of
an idea that will be difficult to digest in this moment
and that film gross I think in the first day 6 crore and this film is 60
it is very clear you know which sort of Alpha male you know our society is leading towards right now I am going to give the last word to Sucharita
Netflix film release hui thi Mayank right where Gary Oldman place humans the person who wrote
citizen King it's a historical about how that film came about and you know why the film is as important as it is not where I think he is talking to the
editor of the film of the producer of the film and the person has to make responsibility return theatre ka
andhere Kamre Mein
sari agency Tumhen Dekhkar Jo baitha hai seat per itne Bade Parde per Dekh Rahe Hain padhte Hue Bhagwan ki Jaisi images usko dikh rahi hai does
what we are saying what we are doing that person and that's what we are responsible
towards people sitting in that dark room it's you put your own morality on reviewing a film you put your own mortality value watching the film you also put
we are a free country we were as much as people are free to make the first week we are also free to push back
art is not calling truth to power what is the point
the conversation before established the fraternity with it that
the director of the film animal is fully within his rights to make whatever film he chooses a loss I love him to do so there is a process in place which
that category it
what is nothing legally wrong with the film that is made do films influence young people older people just
we tend to especially in India make heroes out of film actors we tend to sort of copy that hairstyles
responsibility that comes with being that popular it is not a legally and Foster responsibility but
it involves you know largest society
that should collectively also inform this individual along with what
on the big screen so while the makers of the film animal of fully within their rights to put out a film that is arguably while misogynist
glorifies that virus to put out statements reviews opinion
every
violence doesn't become a reality in the protest or in real life thank you so much
watching enjoy your freedom of speech enjoy your responsibility
