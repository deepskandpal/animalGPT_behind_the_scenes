would my review be different if I was not a man should artist always take a moralistic stance while creating Complex characters or conflicts can you learn good things from a bad fill
am I a closed Sandeep Reddy Vanga stand these are some questions that came to mind after watching Ranbir Kapoor and rashmika mandanna animal directed written
edited by our very own antecedent in maximalist filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga hello and welcome to do I like it shows Har
aur agar tum yah episode animal dekhne se pahle Dekh Rahe Ho To Tum thoda frustrate ho sakte ho Kuchh main Tumhen yah Nahin bataunga ki do I actually like the film or not
Kyunki partly yah mujhe bhi Kuchh Nahin Pata but if you watch the film and are as confused as I am let us come close let us come together join hands and find
space for people like us people like the film but not fully but we agree that there are some super terrible implications but we
don't want to hate on a maker for his heart warning spoilers to Dekho is episode mein hai hi but in addition to that
I might tell me to some descriptions of emotional in physical violence depression anger etc so if you are currently struggling with it please decide whether or not you want to proceed
and now this if you seen any reviews of the film in the past few days you know by now that it's a deeply violent
gymnastic and an overall loud film loudness Ke Niche there is a very tender core which I admit is hard to find because
call the problem matic scenes and dialogues like shaadi Mein Dar Hona chahie aur Ranveer asking his wife you forgive me for all these murders can't you for give me for sleeping around with someone
slap Ranveer character Ranvijay or at least give him your therapist number but if and that's a big if you manage to momentarily look
call that and again one cannot and should not be expected to look past these things all this work feminists will hate this film is pure garbage this film
has some ugly and triggering politics and let's admit it but if you somehow manage to look past this ugliness they might really be a sympathetic exploration
turn off masculinity hidden minute kind of kumbalangi Nights way see when I was a child I had a very Rocky relationship with my father he of
wasn't the multi billionaire Industrialist like Balbir Singh but similar to him he also made a few goof UPS like all new parents do in order to raise us better and fulfill his duty
which I can attach to he did very well as Ranveer says my father is the best father in the world Mujhe
To Main Kya Karta Tha I would take off my specs
punch wooden cupboard now hold that emotion animal is a three are extrapolation of the sponge on a wall
does not mean anything it is just blind rage wanting to challenge itself and in the end it is only yaar the person who is doing the violence
what does that mean we should send this part and label it as violent selfish and analytic or should we engage with it explore why it's
what it is and maybe then try and help it heal the biggest question I had after this film was that is a film what the maker intends it to be
what does the viewers personal experiences change something here she sees on the screen because the film I saw on screen was the loud sexiest regressive
Thailand celebration of masculinity and I am not even exaggerating it is regressive like evolutionary relationship but the film that I took away was a well crafted and a
personal snapshot of a broken soul that stresses on the need for men taking stock of their emotions and seeking help I won't call it a badly written film it is
not a written film only it feels like in every scene Sandeep went to a time in his childhood and thought to himself how can I make people would not leave my life feel the same
I see Ranvijay as a victim more than a much of heroines can you learn something good from a bad film do we excuse Ranvijay
diplomatic behaviour just because he himself is a victim of patriarchy and absent father because trying to find the answer to this question will explain a lot of in cell like
CBR of online trolls of people like and rotate Jiska Kafi influences I really like this film so much why is this
straight up cheerleader review of the film and you know how anyone who doesn't like this film is a snowflake can't take violence I'll tell you why when I had watched Arjun
2017 I was alone in a dark room with headphones on there was just me and the film I could interpreted the way I wanted draw my own meaning
I think that more than a love story the film was about the caste politics between Arjun and pretty look at me like bro which Arjun Reddy
can I get it it's like the maker has made a film specially for me but when I watched animal there was a packed theatre around 75% films with men
and every second I got feedback from people around me quiz on how I should be feeling how the audience is feeling the impact this film is having on people
real time and that changes a few things about the film for me there is a scene in the film where Bobby Deol Abrar Haq has just murdered someone on the day of his third wedding
fourth I don't even know but his face is spread with blood and he forcefully starts having sex with his newly wed wife whose pregnant by the way in front of everyone
once he is done he calls for his other wives in his haram at the knife point where they have blood soaked non consensual sex now I am sure the
would have written this scene to ramp up the villain and deviousness in the antagonist right Jaise Ek Bar Javed Akhtar Ne Gabbar Singh ke bare mein bola tha ki Gabbar is a lecturers character because
they believe ke Koi Kitna bhi ghinauna ho child murder Ho drug dealer Ho but if someone forces themselves upon a woman that's another level of willing and that was Gabbar Singh
show screenplay while I think it's a perfect job very well written scripted villain character but the response I got from a group of friends in a row behind me was
O bhai le gaya with some chuckles and cheers as if a friend of theirs has scored on his first date if Bobby Deol doing this on screen is a demon and
what are those guys and if someone now comes up and says Dekho I so many people came and watch the film they shared in all the scene that you walk is found problem I take what
call that and honestly mujhe nahin Pata ismein main Sandeep Reddy Vanga ko game Karun ya use theatre ke crowd ko Pratiksha from our entertainment team has this one really
line in their review which made so much sense to me they say it is a privilege not watching to be able to watch violence on cinema and realise that
violence like that does not affect you in your daily life is a privilege I won't call animal a wrong film as they do but I can totally understand how terrible it would
someone feel when they hear the hero of the film talk about the pelvis of his loved one and that line is supposed to sweeper of a feet I believe ki agar Kisi
Shekhar ki politics ko Janna Ho uski ideology Jaani ho to uski filmen dekhna you know ki vah use time per Duniya ke bare Mein Kaisa Sochta hai
and my darling Sandeep Reddy Vanga is telling us that it is a man's world he literally says this in one line but more than that he is telling us that
he either doesn't care or cannot do anything about it being a man's world he doesn't really want to change it he is in this man's world slightly
this position is observing it as is sure but not really questioning the consequences of said man's world on other known alphan
people and it's also not a man's world like Anurag Kashyap Gulal or Gangs of Wasseypur where by the end you come out a more
old man I was literally laughing at sardar and Faisal Khan ki Kitni gadhe log hain bhai I hope Mein Ek Badle Ke Piche apni Puri life khatm kar denge
but I already see people coming out of animal and posing in front of that gritty Ranbir poster with the cigarette in his hand with captions like Janwar a Gaya or something like that
that is the difference between the two men's words in talking about Anurag Kashyap I can draw a really strong parallels between him and Sandeep Reddy Vanga both have
super long highly intelligent films about masculinity both of them have a really tight grip on their craft and seem to know exactly what they want with different departments like
edit patterns in their performances and to say the least both of them are original as hell and make really persons but where I stop my fandom of Sandeep Reddy Vanga
when the cinema start permeating into real life in his interview with Anupama Chopra and Kabir Singh he said KR Bachpan Mein To Maine Parinda Dekhi Thi but I didn't become a gang
firstly that not how logic works it's a logical fallacy and an argument from personal incredibility but secondly he fails to recognise the
difference between his films and films like Parinda Chopra turned down a huge sum of money when he was asked to not kill off the main leads Anil
Madhuri Dixit in the end of Parinda he was Adamant on making the point that violence begets violence this is why Satya dies in the end this is why Tony monta
this is my Faisal Khan dies in the end but if Indian men get their ego massage after watching this film this film has failed Sandeep Reddy Vanga has failed Ranbir Kapoor
field on my drive back from the theatre I was blasting urgently in Sari Duniya Jala Denge on repeat and thinking about the rage I would have when
break my specs and how grateful I am for therapy and for some people close to me because of whom I am no longer in this space I got the help
Ranbir Kapoor from animal needed I am not saying that you can't like this film I like this film but please for the love of humanity do not just like this film
you like it please take a moment and think why do you like this film what emotions did these action scenes you know bring with you did your blood boil while watching Ranbir massacre
Mobin old boy style what strings did it plug when Ranveer slashes Bobby Deol's throat while be pregnant in the background Agar Tujhe Ho Gaya Kuchh Sari Duniya
and if that emotion makes you feel uncomfortable instead of getting angry or dismissive about it stay with that emotion and try to see what it would have done to
people around you what the breaking of this Chashma in the bunch of the wall would have done to your family what did Ranvijay is blood thirsty Revenge due to his mother his sister
time until then that gives the women in a break from grown men with daddy issues now I know I will be highly judged for liking this film
just as many people like Pratiksha and Sucharita Tyagi would have been told for not liking it is much but Kya Karen for a film so animalistic but not intended
logon ka response kahan se advance ho jaega but in the end I think I like this film more because it makes me question all of the things about
self and my definition of manhood so is it a good film then maybe or maybe not tell me the comments I have so much to talk about
episode doesn't even scratch the surface so let's continue fighting in the comments and in my DMS This is Pratik and I'll see in the next one
