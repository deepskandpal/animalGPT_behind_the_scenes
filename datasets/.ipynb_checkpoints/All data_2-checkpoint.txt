Awarding the film ./ stars, Bollywood Hungama praised "Ranbir Kapoor’s outstanding performance, clap-worthy massy scenes, and interval block."[] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave / stars and wrote "Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way."[] Ganesh Aaglave of Firstpost gave ./ stars and wrote "Animal is an adrenaline experience which will have polarising views but you can't deny its entertaining quotient, breathtaking performances and storytelling."[] Puja Awasthi of The Week gave ./ stars and wrote "Animal for all its blood and gore, is the story of a son’s aching desire for his father’s approval. Why even its ballads are less romance, more revenge. And its female characters for all their luminosity, are just props". Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times found it "an absolute massy, entertaining and extremely violent thriller which doesn't believe in conforming to the norms", while adding that the extreme violence might be off-putting for some. Titas Chowdhury of News gave ./ stars, labelled it "dark, loud and garish but also unapologetic", and thought that Ranbir Kapoor "breathes life into this undesirable character with a lot of charisma and swag".[] Abhimanyu Mathur of DNA India rated the film ./ and opined, "Animal takes everything that was problematic and increases it several notches. It is downright the most violent Hindi film I have seen, and also one of the most inherently toxic and misogynist. The amazing part is that it is still very well made and entertaining, enhanced further by yet another great performance from Kapoor".

Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote "Ranbir is on fire, inhabiting to a frightening degree Vijay’s delusional personal war.

In a negative review, Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express expressed disappointment that the performances of Ranbir and Anil Kapoor had been "wasted in this pointless, vile tale". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave ./ stars and wrote "The sickeningly violent father-son action drama rarely pauses for breath." Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute gave ./ stars and wrote "Sandeep Reddy Vanga's movie has the kind of writing you'll find in BDSM erotica like Fifty Shades of Grey, but presented with the same earnestness of 'pure love' that we saw in Arjun Reddy." Phuong Le of The Guardian gave / stars and wrote "Animal sinks even further into regressive depths, resulting in one of the vilest protagonists to have graced the big screen."

hello s welcome to Gat Plus thank you first of all I'm very interested in this poster behind you which says not a sandeep reddy vanga film but the sandeep reddy vanga film actually I'll is
that a mistake or no it's a mistake actually the film school you know we uh we always uh heard a professor saying
that you know guys you know you should make the film you should not make a film because so it's it's actually the film
by announcement video and it caught attention and it got a lot of thing and
uh poster designer Anil Banu they felt like let's use this but I F like I'm not
the Himalayas or I'm the state uh let's not use it then I corrected it and
nobody found I mean only you are asking me so I felt
like it's a statement saying the film by you know I I always felt you give 3 years four years for a film so so better
make it yeah it kind of this one so was this the film that was first called devil no that's a different thing that's
a that's a little different characterization that I told to M sir so that's that's a different film that's
that's a different story okay maybe the characterization you might find little uh you know similar but it's a different
story yeah okay so you first started this with a five minute pitch to run be
yeah 10 minutes yeah okay 10 minutes roughly at that point yeah what was the story at that point I had the Beats I I
said uh this is a story about a father and son predominantly it's a love story and This Is The Love Story between
Father and Son yeah this is the madness and this is the milu and this is the you know A to Z so I just mentioned very
like a topography the film runs in Delhi like that you know so you not you'll not
know about the villain at all for a very long time usually what happens is like in the interv will you open the villain
but this is treated this way I majorly spoke about the treatment of the film right so he was pretty impressed I was
like I was in doubt so because uh I was not prepared but I had to meet so that
you know you know that you working with him right so he he said like uh I like the energy of this story I said like
take and after 78 months I met and I narrated the entire I think and it it's 3 three and a half hours right so you
envisioned this as a father son story yes yes yes right but in the same thing
at what point did the point that the sun is an animal
yeah a almost Psychopathic creature when did that flavor come into the sun father son uh stories there so many stories we
always have this tendency of thinking what's in the market already so I thought you know see I can't give ran
sing balir as a character name it becomes like again Arjun RI Kabir another Singh so I didn't want to sound
like that because it's a lengthy name so I thought like it has to be short it has to be very powerful so I don't know when
it happened but somehow I felt suddenly it stried and I called rir and I said what do you think the title animal so he
loved it luckily when we went to register the title nobody has it nobody has it yeah no so at what point was did
you see the begin to see the Sun as this kind of a of an animal like at what
point was that was that right from the beginning or as you started writing the thing did you see okay it'll be
interesting to make this sun like so almost like a psychopath when whenever I get an idea about a story majorly every
time I have the beginning middle and end so when you know what is your end so
you'll root up to it you'll you'll build up to it so in a way I know because I wanted I want I I don't know somehow I I
like the idea of keeping the knife in Father's hand right they say look what I've done for you and if you see the
kind of expression he gives R he's like Pap did you did you gauge what is happening between me and you at least
now is a kind of a thing when I had that in my mind I felt like this is AP thing
it didn't it didn't germinate in between but I thought it it came very instinctively in the beginning itself because because in the speech also he
says like you know in your films let's say two films
basically Arjun d/ Kabir Singh and animal you first Define these flawed men
as to what the flaw is so in Kabir Singh arjin you say this this man has a
serious anger management issue an animal you kind of basically
makeal I forget the exact same same thing something like that you know so pretty much establish what is wrong with
the character and then you take that story onwards why do you feel the need to have that little definition up up
front uh it it it is very uh I I didn't even my brother was saying that do you
notice that you're following a pattern I don't know I mean it I don't know it's
it's very it's I can't really instinctive it's very instinctive and it went with a flow and uh I don't know
there is no there's no I can't dissect it right but uh I have to be very
conscious that that should not come and yeah even in the even in the Arjun also
you know the dean is saying things about him and he wants him to say sorry and like I'm not going to say sorry even he
he's saying that I don't know yeah what draws you to these very
very flawed men because for the longest time the hero was somebody who does good
things who does no wrong first there was the good hero yeah then you got amitab face where the hero was like a vigilante
killer he could do all kinds of bad things he could like want to destroy his father uh he could want to do all kinds
of things like you know you think you did not usually see a hero do and then we went into this love story phase in
Hindi where again Heroes became good again and then now we're seeing a little bit of this so what draws you to this
flawed hero uh you were attracted to that because um what I figured out even
this this question I asked myself also what I figured out from the childhood
whatever films I liked were all flawed man I don't know for some reason can can
you name a couple of films that you like IND Chu Kam shatru is not a flawed man Wes character he's a little angry young
man there's a lot actually in Hindi to there's a lot of films right and majorly this this happened very in a very slow
ascending order but I went into film school you know exposed to World Cinema
it became much bigger but David Fincher Martin scy films watching them Stanley
cubric films so it it it I felt like okay Zone you can tell a story in this
Zone The Confidence came from those World Cinema where I felt like okay fla mena you can tell the story in a very
compelling way then audience will sit through so yeah in animal the nice thing
is or the the interesting thing is even the father becomes a flawed man he's a flawed man as well yeah he's not perfect
either it's not like this guy's rebelling and see for example in Arjun the father's a good guy like like
arjun's the rebel whatever he's got the he's the real up guy but the father is like a good guy but here the
father is also like like he's sted up in his own way you know the accomplishment is so high so it can't there there's no
balance there's no balance yeah yeah yeah so so what pushes you to write in these extremes I think that's what
that's a whole drama that's a drama you get the drama only when when you deal with extreme things or else see imagine
like father was like B father or somebody else other kind of father this this will not be like that you know and
uh even uh even when the mothers is talking to him he says like children need love and attention Balby and the
way he sheds her that shows that you know like he doesn't want to get into that topic because he knew that he's at
fault so yeah yeah so what is uh the way you saw it what is Ran's Arc in the film
uh I'll tell you what I saw let let me know if this is how you saw it in a childhood he's desperate for his
father's love then uh he doesn't get what he wants so so that leads him to
certain uh disturbing behaviors so then father sends him to boarding school
which is like a cage you cage the animal in a in a boarding school and then in America and he comes back as a kind of a
tamed man but when the father is shot and he realizes that the brother-in-law
is is responsible the animal in him bursts out again is that kind of roughly
yeah the thing is like when you when see I felt always that when when you have
that kind of a connection with the parents you know when you are not in touch also there's always that pain you're carrying throughout right that
you know I'm not talking to my father from so long and he's not trying to call him so in a situation like that when you
know that somebody's trying to kill your father I think your emotion doubles and
multiplies I even the anger even the love even the fear of losing becomes much more bigger I think that's where
like this I mean I didn't try to justify also right because in in the edit room
when I was watching from A to Z like not a continuous flow but when in bits and pieces I used to get this
feeling that what has happened with these guys last you know because ranir played it so
well I have no words to express R Beach is an extraordinary performance yeah even I felt that in Sanju and even
rockstar I lost in while I was watching I lost that that it's a cinema
especially it happened only with Sanju for me I forgot that it was a film and it happened with anime also being my own
film so being your feeling happening is like which is really hard it doesn't happen because because I don't hear to
my films music I don't see my film scenes again and again like how people see and how people think like a great
scene so like in the edit room one day I felt like from inside like what's happening with this guys like life you
know that very rarely happens right I was feeling bad I was rooting for him
and I called also R saying that dude what have you done like what is this you know but you know because it's it's a
see point is like when you when you write a scene and when you finish the screenplay and when you're going for the shoot you change few things while you
are little things not majorly but to hold that with you for 3 years it has to have something yeah if
you doesn't feel that it is not holding that for me I don't know about others but I lose interest right few scenes
like I thought like what I don't know how is it but in the edit when I see it
together it was like something else right so that that exercise is more painful and more interesting and more
very you know like you're at at the edge of the thing you know you're gone for
example J killing scene it can go wrong the flight goes up what I meant what I
was giving to the audience is likeah take off you know they say now from here
the story took off so that's where the that's that's what I was symbolically trying to say because I'm doing a little
bit of a CG Green Room CG also I'm doing it the first time I have no knowledge now I have a little understanding about
it so when he stopped the car when he got down there has to be shift of the music also because you can't take the
same background score from the car to the cidor to insert the room killing it has to be mix of bgms also and it should
not like suddenly something is coming it has to go with the feel of your Wizzle
where the Bacha is running towards the father from there it has to follow a pattern of looking like one family of a music you
know that see I think that was more uh I enjoyed that process and at the same
time I was scared also yeah yeah actually since you bring it up your work
in background music which you do that's very unusual because the cues that you give are not the typical oh sad means
I'm put playing a violin uh Happy means I'm playing some something like a you know like a the typical background skew
you go for very unusual instruments uh that leave us a little confused as to what is the emotion at
this point you know that's that that disorientation is something is that is
that because of the music or do you try to give that to the audience I always feel like for example if somebody's getting
angry there's a regular kind of pgms you hear in most of the films I don't want to use that I always try to you know use
a different instrument in a different uh emotion and see whether it's
working uh actually you know this uh this realization started I'll tell you
one sto backstory when I went to film School in Sydney so the moment I landed in Sydney after one week I uh bought a
car one of uh uh my friend's friend was living to Adel so he had this uh 1994 uh
toyoto Camry I bought that for $500 so those days 36 Rupees is the
dollar so it's like 20,000 20 00 I got a car I was excited so I used to go in the
car to the film school and there's one cassette there's only one cassette in the car left one side is STI mutam
another side is Sagar put the casset I was going I used to go via pit Street to
rosebury to my film school that's a route in the pit Street George Street I'm driving it's a big long Tower
buildings and I was like what's happening this
Visual and this audio I used to enjoy those drives every day only onti and S because only one casset
was there right so I there a gentle movies and Indian very Indian very Indian movies and it's in a white
country and uh those long big buildings in between and you see all in the red
light also you see only white CL running and this music S I like that that I used to there
was a time when I used to feel school I want to sit in the car play and going into different streets and enjoy this
music and that visual so maybe it started from there of from at that point I feel like using a very different
peculiar not a regular peculiar sound but a different sound in a different emotion and see how it works right that
X started there yeah is it true that that apart from ranir uh I read in an
interview somewhere recently that apart from ranir nobody knew the story the full story of animal is that true no
rashmika knew few people knew but uh an Anil s you know mock at me saying you
never told the story I told him but uh because it's hard to you know hold Anil s's uh attention so he'll shift into a
different topic and so that that way he felt that I didn't narrate the story but wantedly I didn't narrate to Bobby sir
because I didn't want him to know the story okay because I I thought like he's playing mute any he was half of the expression is gone when you're playing
mute I thought like I don't want to know the story it will I thought it will create something uh new in him because
keeping him in that not knowing the story yeah actually that helped that helped but rest of them I told I uh but
not because I accept that the the kind of depth with the emotion I narrated to
ranir for 4 hours I didn't do the same with everybody else yeah now you you said that you know he becomes an uh you
know like like Angry after he hears that his father is shot right but there is this this scene where for the first time
he comes back from America with his wife and kids and the brother-in-law vun is
his name he says you wait here you know like and he listens he doesn't say like
there's no animal bursting out and saying like he's my papa who the are you to say like let me not go inside
or something like that he calmly patiently Waits why does he wait no I I
felt like he's coming after eight seven years six years yeah six seven years and he knew that if he talks like that there
is going to be uh you know you know he doesn't want to create a issue there and if you remember rashmika says like
please don't do anything knowing his temperament so I I wantedly kept him quiet because he felt like this is not
the right situation it's not a 60th birthday party anymore to talk to him like that and he knows that if he comes
to know again he's going to feel bad and they're coming after so many years he just want to meet his father forget
about what's happening around he's very confident that you know he's going to deal once he gets his when the father
says like you know you know Papa watch out then that's that's
that's a way in a way father is also saying that you are not there in a very subtle way so I thought like when you
get that from the father then rest everything will with away so I didn't give any
that you take care like kissing on the hand godfa you came
back next thing is like he goes and talks to Shak and from there go a
factory I thought like I'll show the aggression in the factory in the factory yeah yeah you know that the way he was
saying those lines and all that I thought rather than showing there pushing the G I thought this let's not
do that so deliberately I made him sit quiet sitting with the workers where you felt also no you I felt like audience
will feel there you know yeah yeah and that's really what what for me at least why your films work so well because what
I expect you're not giving me okay because I would think think that when an angry son comes back or rather worried
son comes back and this GJ of all people tells him that uh don't see your dad now
I would think he just shove him aside and say I'm a son who the hell are you to tell me not to see my dad that's my
expectation right but you're breaking that expectation and putting that yeah now this is is this again an instinctive
thing or do you think that this is what the audience will expect let me do something different sometimes I do that
sometimes it's very instinctive to to be very friend because I thought um you know when a father will also ask him
yeah papa it's not important he say that's not important because he could have easily said you know the warun made
me wait but he'll tell to Shakti Uncle you know Mishra Uncle SOA you know you feel that yeah he's a
true successor and he's been that's why I wantedly made him smoking with the workers he just sadly smoking and he
comes he's shocked champ what are you doing here I thought this this is what I want to see this when when places like this I want deliberately make the
audience feel you know okay so that's what he says like you know when he says the Jesus is
and the cousins giving back you know those things we wantedly placed it like yeah right why does he go
to the pin I felt when I think personally when I think this also like how do you how do you judge a bodyguard
how do you trust him right because when you see uh big people with body go I have this feeling how do you judge that
guy he can easily come turn and shoot you just like that like how do you trust when you're having so much money I
thought like he'll because he knew that he has a lot of cousins so I thought like the Inner Circle will be more
secured if you have from your blood and brothers and all that so that's what he
says like you know that's that's a straight line from Godfather yeah but history has taught us something like anybody can kill anybody
yeah how do we trust them right then he I thought like in the in the group
picture also he takes that topic out but there's a strange Factor already
established yeah so I thought like that he'll go he'll reconcile the relationship and get the cousins that's a high moment I felt it's a very
cinematic High yeah and like you know they there's not dialogue I wantedly thought like let's see without a
dialogue and we I got the bgm we got the bgm before so I was playing in the set it was full of adrenaline all uh you
know yeah tall Punjabi guys coming and touching his feet and he's also like you
know an also baffled looking at who are these guys full of 12 people standing and when I was shooting when I was
looking at everybody I thought like we should have a dialogue the dialog was not in the script like R I like
something you should say a simple dialogue it will work it's a very simple and we heard 100
times but the placement is everything so so lethal at that point background score
quiet when he says all this Eco also little because there a high roof uh houses so I thought we add a little Eco
in the dialogue so all that worked yeah what I liked also about that is that we
see these very strange photographs of these sardars and all that in aril's
office and we like you noticed H great but it's there no like so I'm like who
are these people what are these strange photographs and all that and then you kind of yeah I wanted to create that but you know so many times you do few things
nobody notices it but you still want to do that good that you bought this nobody's asked me about this right it's
like it gives a feeling that you belong there yeah so I'm like these guys are not dressed in turbans and all that but
who are those people and like why does he have all that so there's definitely some story happening there so and then
you get this so it's like wow okay so that's the connection yeah so uh it's a deliberate brief given to my production
designer SES uh that we will will put this let's not put a closeup but maybe
in the background also yeah I like to put that kind of detail in the films yeah there's a frame that that uh May
mean nothing but I just love that frame when ranir brings ganali uh rashmika to
meet his father the bookshelf the bookshelf they're standing at the corner of this Frame and it's a wide shot and
you have that entire enormous uh wall to
flor bookshelves and they're looking like two pathetic like school kids out there tell me how you I wanted to give
that feeling that you know it's it's like he's your father but he's a powerful man yeah sitting with the chief
Min having a coffee so I wanted to create that you know you wanted validation call it you wanted your love
of your father everything but your father is not a regular father right now we said like girl of my house you went
out and you found the girl came back and and for him to come and show I think only when you are you know
unconditionally in love with somebody you can do that you know keeping your strength and ego aside and you walk into
the room and say papa you know I want you to meet somebody special that's what he says like you know when he's not
looking at him he'll say Pap don't think that with this you know
I'll come and meet and get married I'll sit at home he's still saying our equation is same right I'm still going
away from the hor but I want to know that this is the girl I'm getting myri so those bookshelves are kind of symbol
of the dad's power and position yeah I thought like and I hardly use any white shots entire film I have I think like
three or four white shots yeah yeah so I thought like this is the only situation see I I felt like see you felt like so
powerful also because of the reason also that you know I don't use just for the sake of using yeah they like two tiny
people there you know so and even the girl in the little frog it is making more school kids kind of a feeling he
also very excited having a smug on his face okay I'm excited that I want to show you to my father you know yeah the
question is also like that you want to sit you want to drink some water she say no you know yeah you know with this run beir again let's go back to his Arc what
made me so emotional at the end he's a beast trying to a protect his
father B get his father to love him the way he wants to love him and when he thinks that he has done everything that
he can to protect his father that gets leukemia yeah so he's going to lose his father anyway like after all this after
this murderous Rampage of of you know uh doing all these horrible things uh he
still can't save his father yeah tell me why did you want that sense of him being a bit of a losing things at
the end you're saying that like I'm saying you could have just as easily have reconciled them at the end right
but you chose not to do that you're like after all this this I'm still going to lose my dad my wife is walking away uh
before that I lost my hearing uh I lost my blad control bodily functions there's
so much that he loses yeah what made you go towards that direction actually this was when I narrated the 10 minutes idea
to that was there that time also this idea because this is where I felt like
you know I I personally feel uh with what my understanding on life is
U great things are shortlived right there's nothing like the way he comes and sits and says Papa let's go for a
holiday you know we we deserve a holiday it's life is not like that I I felt I
felt like you have not achieved anything in a way I want to say that you killed so many people I know they came to kill
you but but still you've killed so many people I felt like you know the the
church father says there's no Redemption a destructive force that's a fact people might be laughing because the way the
father got iritated but whatever the Swami G and father is saying they are facts even the Swami says like you
know 36 is the limit he says but I chopped the diog because the length he says 37 is your limit since he got the
heart so he's alive or is there's no because heart transplantation is today's
world is happening like 50 years back 40 years back there's no heart transplant that means you're dead so according to
the jatak and all he's gone I always felt in love stories accomplishment feeling should not be there I don't know
why I feel that maybe um I don't know the reason but I felt that will be more
dramatic in spite of doing so much you didn't get anything and deliberately I
didn't want them to hug also when they're crying I didn't want I felt like
you know the way he's giving back to the father is
saying is openly saying that because he's saying with a lot of pain and he walked away with that report if you
notice he's holding that report still feeling something can be done calling his friends in Us and something like
that when the father stops him and saying that the same thing what he wrote when he was a kid he's saying it now rir
gives a kind of expression what's the point if you understood now then he still walks away and I felt like he's so
helpless that he's holding Mishra unle and crying I don't know whether the dialogue you heard he says like Mish
yeah yeah I felt like this character never cries and he's saying you're dead
yeah Singh story is over right because he's never confused or he's like
that so I felt like I should leave the audience with that emotion in the climax
but I always had this feeling of a part two yeah so I thought like let's give a glimpse so I started that because
there's a there was a feeling for me strongly me and ranir majorly ranir strong felt like um the idea is great
but we should use this scene now even I thought like let's use it because which scene is this the the the chopper scene
the the butcher scene so I thought like I'll I'll take it little while I keep a blank screen for a while and then
use because I wanted to leave that feeling for a while you know but that
complaint I always have that feeling I opened the butcher but uh yeah right
because this feeling is going to continue for a while in the part two so I thought like okay when you see it like volume one volume two you'll be you know
you'll feel nice right at that point you know when ranir realizes that I've
done all this and I'm still a loser at that point he says let's do this play
acting you become the dad I'll become the dad and you become the son what made
you say that's the point I want this uh final frustration to kind of break out
there no matter he's saying he's saying that but he knew it's
gone saying like fourth stage third stage he knew that much and he's saying
I thought this is the chance I'm going to went out my frustration all my lifelong
yeah he's saying like only we'll do one day let's he says like let's do one day when Michael
Jackson came to India so so I thought uh even that water splashing on his face
and everything you know I thought there's a huge drama because you never seen him shoting on him you always
seen father is slapping shouting on him calling him Pig putting on weight we never see son doing it I thought it will
be very hard-hitting and Powerful when we make the son talk like that and even when the mother comes is like Mama you
stay outside it's between me and my father and I got this chance after 35 years so I don't know this very
instinctively happened I thought like maybe this is how this guy should behave at this point if he holds Papa's hand
and saying Papa don't worry I'll make it all right and they're walking in the lawn it's not going to work I thought
exactly what I'm saying you're you're giving me something that I'm not expecting at that point at all though of
course you gave me a series of things that I didn't expect so even at this point I was like okay I know there's this is not going to be a conventional
hug and papa that kind of scene is not going to happen so I kind of knew that was going somewh but this is something I
did not expect now tell me one thing what do Anil kapur's of course he loves
his son in a in a general way but is he also troubled by the boy like why is he
so violent why is he so like what is this feeling towards his son because I love that
line so why why does he say that it's like uh what does that mean because I
feel he's a he must have understood when he was in fifth standard only that he's a if when he becomes an adult he'll be a
very protective uh uh son towards me right he must have underst because when he sees how he's behaving with the
sister holding the rifle and going to the college and uh and he's saying actually
this is one line I removed it he says like what's the point of being so wealthy in life I thought like let's not
give that no the kid says say so you removed that wealth I thought like he
should not give idea that because kids get that actually kids who were 14 15 16 17 in that age if they know that father
is Rich right then they will play that accordingly based on G you know how the environment is at
home so when the father is not available only at home so obviously there's 100%
tendency that the kids fall into that trap of the we are rich you know somewhere see he slapped him he was sent
him to the boarding school but somewhere he knew that what a guy you know he's
did a wrong thing it's according to the law and order it's not right but Papa I know that he's a criminal but look at
his Fury look at the kind of you know at ude he has so so in a in a way he
admires yeah in a way he felt like maybe if you were here this wouldn't have happened right that's why I was missing
you so that's what I said that's a very subtle validation yeah the subtle thing that okay now we are joining our hands I
didn't want to show it in a symbolism but in a dialogue and even I if you notice he don't he's not knowing what to
talk that's why he's going on the chest hair yeah say I never saw you with the chest because he didn't know how to react
because because this kind of situation happened in the past then he knows Papa don't worry he'll hug but he never had
that moment so he don't know how to behave whether hold his knees or hold his hand or put a hand on his shoulder
so he's like he if you see R like a phenomenal job he did every shot he was
great but he's not looking into his eyes yeah he talk about that and immediately Shak Uncle comes and says you know
doctors were confused and the nurse comes and say that's over right after that father is shocked looking at the TV what is he doing in the factory so I
wanted to give that only I didn't want them to meet only yeah I have created a situation like that he from there he
went to the factory from there he goes to the pin he gets the cousins and it's out of order yeah he just go it's out of
his hands yeah so even the phone call sister is saying like he can't do anything he stopped at the gate yeah so
I didn't create a situation only where the conventional things will come yeah yeah so that was a hard part actually in the writing to not to create that
conventional thing and still jump in the screenplay and still make it compelling was actually to time actually right I
love the fact that uh because I love Masala Cinema so The Echoes when are a
big part of it so when the same japel goali comes when Bobby and and uh uh he
are fighting at the airport and he's almost being overpowered but then he remembers the dad telling him that and
like that's the man I have to protect and he gets that surge of power back uh
that was like a real Goose flesh moment actually what actually what I thought was even Bob sir has
a backstory like right you know I shot also but CG delay and I thought like
let's not because it's not fitting with the music for somehow yeah even when uh rir is hitting Bobby even there glimpse
of like 14y old guy 13y old guy running towards a grandfather grandfather is in the fire he's in shock that's where he
Los his voice and all that no I thought flash cut because I didn't want just for the sake of villain is a b guy
yeah he also has equal reasons to kill balir but somehow in the music in that pattern it is not sitting and I thought
in the edit only I thought let's not use it I will only use this there's many many funny moments in this movie but one
of my favorite funny moments is when d goes to pin gets all those people and I love Anil kapur's face when all these
people are touching his feet and he's like what the is happening here you know just like he's just going like like
oh God okay whatever you know so something's happening here I'm not understanding this so it's like that was
particularly gave look for everybody that is what which worked actually yeah he didn't you know ignore even not even
one 11 people everybody was looking at it because it worked yeah you you laughed at that point because he's yeah
I was I was just because the thing is he did not expect this because first of all there is a family history there yeah so
he's not even sure that see when he himself is so distanced from his uh relatives he would think his son is even
more distanced from them but for that boy to go there and get all these people back and suddenly he's like having a
mini family reunion at at one time he's not even expecting anything he's like totally like mind like he's gone like I
don't know what's happening and anel played that moment beautifully because it was like like uh you know he's just
like so confused you know what's happening here so uh that was lovely
yeah so did you see parts of this movie as a dark comedy because for me it definitely felt like there were parts of
this that were a dark comedy yeah okay did you feel that at all n there there's a humor which is very organically
unfolding I thought okay it's nice such a dark film I thought like little humor it's better so whenever it is
coming I didn't uh stopped it I let it happen even the prostitute scene and all that yeah I thought like yeah let's
let's go with the flow right when the when the cousins are with with those uh
women and all that kind of stuff it it was just a random scene there it's just a random scene I thought like I'll break
the eyes also because see either you celebrate with your cousins either you SC them then only you'll have a kind of
understanding or you're breaking the ice celebration I I didn't find any reason to celebrate for any other reason
because uh other than two three cousins rest of them are like a little strangers only to them because one guy is a fan
one guy the J is like kabu and all that it's in the in the entire lot one two
people are close to him but the rest of them are like I thought like uh it's a nice comic relief also it is and you and
now you individually you identify everybody what happened in the screenplay you say you see them like
bodyguards when rashika says like you know bodyguards he says like don't dare to say body they my cousins okay they're
cousins the first time you view him you see in the pin like group of people talking but you don't identify you know
really like who is who so I thought that scene was actually helped yeah it's like
to demarcate who's who but in a strange way that scene also has an echo because
he's telling these guys what if one of these women is a spy and later he gets a
spy uh in the form of soya so it kind of like like like kind of has a that's
that's why the in the in the swimming pool scene where he comes and says like you know the difference is we pay and
he's using his talent you know yeah so you both are you all equal then that guy
say he making the fruit juice or whatever it like now you mentioned uh
The Godfather I noticed quite a few similarities in The Godfather uh that
film also opens with a long celebration of a wedding and this one opens uh not
opens but there's a big 60th birthday uh celebration of of of the dad thing where
lots of things happen there also the brother-in-law is instrumental in betraying the the that's why the dawn
get shot and here too the same thing happens and there to Michael kills his brother-in-law and here rir kills his
brother-in-law and there to there's a scene where the his sister hits out at him for killing her husband and here do
that kind of a thing these are things that did you were you thinking of Godfather when you did these or did he
just accidentally happened this actually very uh organically because I saw God
for some 30 40 times yeah yeah so it's inside you yeah maybe yeah even even in Arjun and kabi they said there's a bit
of daas maybe you know I I've watched too many versions of daas so maybe so
that way it kind of uh thing because even that car explosion yeah that's there in Godfather too okay okay yeah
but in a different context definitely a different context but I wasn't sure whether you were like let's give a
little homage to Godfather kind of a thing or it just come organically I I didn't actually try to give homage but
uh I I knew this one this party thing it is it is a little similarities are there
right but sister thing uh he didn't uh Michael will say is still quiet about it
yeah I I thought like but telling to sister was a little going overboard
but it was it went smooth that scene was actually it was
unnecessary I thought he's making a point you know right because I feel like
I know this's one point where you say there's unconditional love which is happening in Arjun and Kabir but deep down you feel somewhere subconsciously
you notice everything right so I thought let's get that point also yeah so what
is the uh the reason you began with ranir at 60 because uh because keeping
part two part three in mind oh so you were thinking about that yeah I thought like you know maybe part two part three
the old man is narrating you know I thought um it's nice way of opening the
film with laughter and there's a relatively there's he's taking a monkey joke yeah
monkey is a kind of animal which has no control of you know you know this they
say you know like you know don't behave like monkey that means that so most of the times you don't have a control on it
and out of all animals the way you say monkey only you'll feel something about it I don't know the way you pronounce it
or you know so that's a very old joke in uh from Karnataka when I was in studying
physio I heard this joke 20 years back I don't know it stayed with me there was a time when when in the college when
somebody said they never used to turn back because you know what you're going to do he's going to do that so it was
that famous joke so because he start the moment is it's
like 100 years of swastic Celebration I thought like it will not be like 3,000 people it will like only close people 15
or 20 people that drunk till morning and he's talking about his father cousins must have heard that story like 150
times that's why they are like man how many times you going to narate the same story to me and he looks at
everybody and he says like okay you don't want actually there's a dialogue he says
I thought like when the edit I don't need that dialog also it is coming through his eyes so much that I there's
no need for me to use the dialogue right then he say okay guys I'll put the glass and I'll tell you a joke then everybody
are laughing he's just looking at them he's looking at in a way that okay you guys only need this yeah when you when
they're laughing yeah the camera goes in close to Rand and at least I thought I
saw a bit of sadness in his eyes yes yes yes thought right because because when you when you see father dying with
leukemia in the climax in the and you know that he's going to die so you don't
know how the death happened right so I thought like 6 you're 60 years old and you're still feeling for father that
means that Lely I didn't think of that because I've noticed my uncles and in my
in my real life also other people um people who lose parent at the age of 30s
and 40s and who lose parent at the age of 60 the pain is not say I don't know why it find I find it very strange but
is that monkey story also a kind of uh indication that we are still animals in
some way and weable of that is a straight inclination because we title animal so talking about animal yeah so
yeah we are not capable of change that's the the thing we are basically animals yeah yeah we are yeah because we have IQ
and we have communication we on the top or else would have ruled out you know
right so when you have these these scenes like he's walking around naked uh
like an animal uh or he has a very territorial Behavior towards his father or when he when he's like he tells his
wife let's make love in the open are these all things that came after you thought of him as an animal or these are
again scenes that you just did because they felt organic no this this is uh this is a feeling that uh it gives
animal uh you know characteristic feature like you know so she's behaving like human he's saying like you know
this is our private trip nobody's going to watch and all that and uh uh I
thought the the idea of putting the bed on the runway itself is uh it's a
different you know and we I don't know how many noticed we put the at the edge of the takeoff Point actually you know
those blue lines of lights so too much of detail I don't know that people have noticed but I thought they're going to make love and it's a takeoff point you
know symbolically I want to say so many things I don't know whether it can or not but yeah that's the major idea is
like can it's a very interesting idea and interesting thought also to talk with you know in a newly married
discussion it's very nice co you talk and next day morning suddenly it becomes about the father so I want to show that
difference also so after this you know you you have them and then the plane you said it symbolically the story takes off
and it almost hits the mountain but he goes up then comes the most interesting screenplay decision that you make which
is the plane vanishes into the clouds the clouds clear and suddenly a car comes into the frame
and a bearded like animal that that is the animal R that's the post like you
know that animal rbe gets gets out and suddenly he's going and killing his his
G there is no context why did it occur to you that I want the sudden jump to
this animal and then give the story of why he's killing the G yeah I just want
to give a shock value because if he comes back from years and he's going to
pin and get the factory it's again you're waiting you're waiting on what's going to happen you know what's going to
happen are very smart then he knew he because he
said establish the rift very clearly he tells to the younger one saying when I
was when she was getting Mar a form to control things but your
marriage I'll control so I thought like after this romance thing I want to give it it's call it cinematic high or high
with the masses you know that was a very deliberate attempt that you know I want the story to take off with a very high
cinematic scene because when you are killing J by then only few people I knew half of the HM will be in shock half of
the will be in like what a scene because because we are always rooting with the hero when it's a character film and if
somebody upsets hero you are not happy with that guy so he's killing and the way he got the power back from the point
where the way he's talking to him upset he got the authority there from there
there's shift of authority shift of so many things and you see those gang walking inside the room it looks very
powerful yeah and when we come back and there's a normal domestic scene where rashik is coming and hugging we've shown
some toys kids are sleeping that's now you know that oh now it's like 78 years ahead yeah and
suddenly Papa she comes then we go back to the story it would be an interesting uh or as I I felt I never
wanted a regular screenplay because we have seen this kind of stories yeah yeah only a screenplay and the
characterization will make it interesting right like you'll see half of the film you are done yeah you know ranbi takes so many
slaps from his father and from his wife yeah he never gets angry at all yeah like it's almost like he he kind of what
is going I feel he's beyond that okay because uh he knew that he playing with
a strap he knew that he's not supposed to do he gets SL that's why he'll have a smoke on his face you know that he's
going overboard but so he's pulling that brass STP why because I I felt see when
you have a little sprain or a fracture or a small thing on little putty you get
so irritated sometimes and things doesn't happen maybe your phone is not charging also you get angry because you
already have a splint so much has happened with him and
uh father wants the cousins to live and he's coming and sharting on the father saying that you don't trust me and his
all CES uh the maid comes and says like she's signing obviously doesn't want
everybody to feel that he's deaf so you throw the food and he feels the Gan should
understand about this and she puts a salt with the viscosity actually dial
viscosity he said Visos thickness yeah then he'll get he'll get angry like
so much is happening with me you're putting salt in my food in a very light way he says
like Po she's going and throwing the food she's preparing another new ball but I
feel for a man it will hit you from inside like wait what has happened with me she's putting salt in my food
that's why he's like okay now I'll play with you and he is a You Know M of cut out and he if you see first one is
like in a very lighter way he does that like in a very romantic way he does that after that then very clearly you see
when the camera comes front you see ranir growing in the frame with a little uh different kind of anger I don't know
how to say all put it in words he'll just bend like that and say what were you
talking to your mother knowing he knew that she will not talk anything ill about him but he always have this a
strange feeling with her parents because they have never met yeah because there was there was a scene which was written
which I didn't shoot was in the hospital the parents come to visit him so he'll
tell to ganali why your mother is giving me that kind of a look as though I'm bedden from one year it's only two days
it's only 10 days there should be hope I don't see any hope in your mother's eyes so from there we reach here so I chopped
I removed that but I felt like since you try to hurt me I'll try to hurt you
right so that's why I thought like you know when he came when he's leaning toward talking to her when he's pulling
the pony I thought like what else he'll do maybe he'll you know play with the strap and uh right no I'm saying this is
also some this is a for many people this kind of scene is a trigger point right because it kind of domestic violence
yeah domestic violence not yeah in a way it's like it's like you're
psychologically aware of why see no we you're aware that this is a very imperfect character but when you see
them doing this thing or when you see uh ranbi talking about uh you have a big
pelvis uh that that you have big hips childbearing hips one part of me is
understanding the character and saying that yes he is not a like a normal guy
so he's not going he's going to behave like a crude uh animal right but another
part of me is also like oh my God that's such a like a crude line so tell tell me when you put these scenes in or even
that scene where uh uh he she takes off her top and uh she's standing in front
of him and he's like oh my God you look so good for a mother of two what's what's running through your mind when
you put these scenes is it partly again shock value or is it also is it
something else it's a surprise value shock value and see he's when they had this thing in the school high school and
after that they were never in touch and um he's trying to say what has happened
in the past with his brother with her brother and with her he's saying about Alpha Beta and all that and he's saying
if you are in that situation bunch of herin alpha she's saying Alpha but he's not saying listen we had this emotion in
school and I really love he was not able to say that he's trying to come in a know different route explaining her
because it is the engagement day and they were not in touch and suddenly you know coming with that force and saying
listen Gan I really love you you know what has happened between us he can't say that so he's trying to explain a
theory which is related to his character also the title also for the film for the audience when they're watching it
doesn't seem like what theory is talking it gives a feeling that character that
is what the information we are getting and she walked away and while he was
talking he didn't even realize when he kept his hand on the feet yeah actually I thought of shooting B like you know
he's just playing with the pedals the flers and he just put a hand on her feet I wanted to shoot that but I thought I'll not show it then I figured out on
the shooting day itself let's not show that let's give again a shock the girl looks at me I didn't even realize that
you're touching my feet you didn't even realize M for the girl side you are engrossed in the discussion that's what
I felt like we'll convey that and very sweetly he'll remove the hand and he
also feeling that you know maybe I cross a line of touching it gives that look and she also gives a little irritated
look and she's walking away I felt like she's walking away he
knew without saying one more line he knew that she's gone so how should I say
that I'm seeing future with you I want to marry you so I thought like in this situations boys behave very differently
sometimes your intention is something else but you end up saying something else so he didn't know what to say then
I this was a brief given to rir Al I said like suddenly you don't know what to say G you got big
so he you are fat so he's saying he's giving a reason he's saying that I'm seeing future with you that you know we'll get married and we'll have babies
so that uh I thought that was uh compliment I never thought it's uh I
mean like you you found it uh ugly no see one part of me I understood that that this guy is not a like a normal guy
right it's like he's not going to tell like he's not going to behave with anybody properly leave alone men women
everybody be but that line because you have childbearing hips it it took me back to
the medieval times when women used to be evaluated on on like you know they they'll examine everything about a woman
and see whether she's fit for marriage or kind of a thing which doesn't happen anymore true so that's what was little
like it made me win yeah because he was he spoke about a stone age yeah right before into the discussion I thought
it's a continuous thing to say and U that's what I say so in the character it
fits but when you're watching it it makes you like go back a little and and kind of a thing so but tell me this this
foot thing that you brought up right again in that kvot scene he's touching her feet when she gets out in Kashmir uh
he's very lovingly putting the the winter boots on her naked feet when Zoya
comes he points to his foot and says uh you know like like kiss my boots if you
really love me what is this thing with feet throughout the movie It's like a no I feel in in a relationship every
everybody has a way of uh you know touching and cuddling and kissing everybody have yeah I thought like I
give this feet idea I mean like it's it's a I don't know how to put it but uh you know you have the idea of you know
in few couples we see they hold hand and they kiss on the dorsum of the hand and it's it's it's kind of their uh thing in
a relationship so I thought touching the feet or holding the feet his thing yeah
I thought it'll be yeah and um coming to that uh what you said about uh
removing the top and saying that one because I don't know how many people have noticed uh you know out of five
sense organs three are gone yeah smell taste and hearing so only touch and
vision is left so I thought that's the only thing which is working so for that
I thought he'll ask her to do that you know and he hugs and so he's so out of
shape so he's in a way complimenting saying you know look at yourself you
know that I thought that's a way of complimenting in a Rel guy now and father calls him a pig yeah and so I
thought like you know there's a line actually look at me and look at you but I thought like forget about look at me
says you know look at you mother of two kids and he signs I thought like he's happy for her yeah it's a nice
compliment uh you know relationship after so much has happened the strap thing and all that why did you have the
maid at the corner of the frame oh I want it because uh because if if when he if you if you notice when he'll touch
like that and he'll say like this the mannerism also like a b because uh I
didn't want to say that remove the top you know and even when yeah when she
she'll drop the chuni like that like I didn't want the chuni to remove and put it like that it's like it has to it's
like one drop and one lift it has to be like a b again then I thought like she if she checking the surrounding it's G
the romance is gone so I thought like forget about the surrounding he wants me to do this I'll do it for him and
there's a Focus Shift cu the same made where she got scolding so I thought like well it would be nice to shift on it to
show that how they're unaware of the surroundings right so I think uh I
thought that will be nice as a see like a romance right you know forget about the world it's that kind of a feeling no
in the sandip r Wanga world uh the women are also a little uh how do I put it uh
wacky uh they're not doing the things that the women typically do for example
uh in Arjun when he comes and sleeps on her lab actually there in this film too
there's this uh that's what I not yeah yeah yeah this is again a I was like is this sandep echoing Arjun ready or what
is he doing it's like where he comes near where the children are play the bathtub and she says come and then he
puts his r put his head on gitanjali's lap uh so it's like a very similar scene
to what arjuni does another thing is uh the women you show them as the
initiators of sex uh in Arjun RI also it's prti who initiates the kiss and
then the love making uh it's not it's not Arjun even though he's kind of a thing whereas here also there is that
scene where she kind of wears the lery and comes and uh uh she's like in this
this mood to make love and she comes in front of him I never thought this you never thought this I never thought this I swear I never thought this I'm like
I'm like why these women even this sleeping on the lap I never thought okay yeah because you never remember no no
now I'm surprised actually even this thought of you know they tried first yeah I never thought I thought this is
something that you're doing deliberately because no because they are like initiating this thing whereas the guy is
like he's like uh you know I'm not in the mood I'm I'm kind of uh you know
this this thing that thing that thing so that thing I didn't deliberately put the approach but I wanted to get into see
what discussion they had in the flight very other than you know don't talk about my father like that what do you
mean you know my father's a great father than that line I I want to show that this is a shift of discussion yeah you
know hardly they spoke anything and now suddenly you see there's a big argument happening I thought that would be nice
uh dramatic question you and it's very nice because there too your showing him as somebody who's so preoccupied with
something else because she says uh I'll be ready like this and she says okay she does this and he's like you're not
you're not you don't want to make talk to me anymore and then she goes back inside and then he follows her inside so
in a way she's kind of like he follows her around like uh he it's not like from
the US when you when you see people living in us the kind of Lifestyle they have and when you come and stay in a
house where the in-laws are there it is not the same for the because women are very independent in us especially Indian
women they you ask any most of them they doesn't want to come to India they feel it's much independent space right
you come to a I know it's a huge place it's a palace kind of a house but still in-laws staying and all I felt like
everything is a little in control now you know so I thought like maybe he must
be busy with so much things happening around so we are not showing that it's understood now in the screen play so I
I thought like what what will be the discussion between both of them yeah other than uh if not this so a regular
discussion will be very boring yeah so yeah they can't be talking about oh I'm so sorry about your dad or whatever
because again I want to make it you know I don't know why we have come here we are so happy in us so I want that thing
to happen so that I want to go back to the story so then you have that pattern so you have to place these things very
rightly we can't show any other thing other than that also but this is I never thought huh the sleeping in the lab and
all that have to be very careful now I never thought actually because
even the poster also unless somebody outside person said oh they're saying
specs beard the same poster they're saying like I didn't even thought about that so
I have to be really careful seriously because yeah but when we shooting I was
feeling like the way uh rashmika calls him come I feel like she's calling a kid
actually even on Arjun R it plays like that because had she not see she kind of
she's not like oh God this is so disgusting or something like that right she is she's actually calling a friend
and saying bring a blanket and she's she's like treating him like a baby yeah this overboard yeah yeah so this is also
you know I was like this is okay this is wife and husband but that's like she's new in the college that was a little
overboard but I thought like it will go well with the audience you know whoever is watching you like okay let's see what
happens for me I I look at your women being as nuts as the men and that's that's kind of they're also kind
of off you know like like they're not the regular women they're like they're little off which kind of when I say off
it means like for example in Arjun ready during that song I you know that's when you really know that that she's also
like like so extreme because they're going somewhere the motorbike uh
Accident Happens they fall down and instead of like uh dusting off or
checking themselves or whatever it is they run towards each other uh when the you know like with all their wounds and
bruises and blood and this and that so I'm like you guys are made for each other you know because both of you are so extreme here too you get that feeling
that only rashmika can probably control uh ranir yeah you know there's nobody
else who can his father can't control him of the sisters or whatever it is only she has true I gave a little hint
in few areas where you know if you notice she says like don't do anything yeah while taking the kid yeah and even
when he's sitting alone she's giving him that constant look saying like see you we have we just left everything and we
came and you don't even get to see your father what's happening that kind of look is there already and when the sister is talking also she'll check
ranir whether he's reacting or not then she'll say so that was very and rashmika killed
it that you transform and she didn't I mean it went very came very effortlessly in the look also we didn't
try much only through the dialogue and the way she's emoting we saw that six years of difference in the
Rel let's talk about that big action block right uh in that that open because
for me the film I don't like to talk about films and acts in terms of Acts
because it varies I don't believe that yeah I never understood that yeah but in this film I deliberately feel there are
two acts the First Act end of First Act he dies and the beginning of second and
then he's resurrected and then in a way he loses everything so it's like almost like two chapters of his life you know
because he that's that's how I I I saw this and even the fight sequence is
divided into three acts right the the first time he fights with the
uh with s with a regular gun gun with a gun the second second act he fights with an axe and then the third act he that
big uh Made in India atbar uh uh what do you call it at it's it's his line no no
what what is that thing called what do you call it like that that that that machine yeah it's a we can call it a war machine yeah a war machine so the that's
the third act right what made you say I just don't want one regular fight
sequence I want the scene divided into three acts with three different weapons yes yes yes that's a deliberate thing we
have divided with the music yeah I wanted it to like you know it's it's not ending it's it's it's actually maybe uh
the inspiration is from kilil know Kil if you remember one fight it's never ending yeah I I found it uh like I was
uh very hooked to it I saw it multiple times and it is holding my attention like it l fight still it's about 20
minutes right I think I think yeah I think it's 20 22 minutes yeah so I thought like you know there will be
group of people coming coming coming I thought with the music and there's a dialogue in between there's changing
flowers and you know breaking the Box there's so many things happening like a scene there's a discussion in between
where the you know the Freddy guy comes and gives a description that's terrific casting by the
way he's a great he's a great actor I'm like the casting was so bang on it was
and that tiger underwear yeah even that dialogue is his idea that sound is
making that sound it's his idea and at line is that he read the line he said
like you know manufactured in Bangalore made in Maharashtra Made in India he said like sandip let's use
this I like super abuse it then it was yeah there's a full you know whistling
and cheering in the theater for that line right so you divided it as one yeah yeah and of course the song
happened then and AR and it just became viral because
of of this every every bit of the film is viral every even the you see so many
people are parting putting the glass it's it's Madness I we never thought
that level so this kind of said you you saw Kil and said let's also make a you
know I thought I was surprised you know usually in in in our films especially in the South films few
action episodes we'll be bored so that maybe happens because it's
happening only in one particular area there's no dialogue or there's no break in between so I when I first time saw
kilil that fight I thought like very smartly done it's like a scene it's not Action episode so that I don't know that
remained in me I don't know because when in the few review writers said that kilbil action he must have inspired then
I felt like yeah I saw it because when the first time I saw I thought like what a scene it was yeah so and
being a Punjabi guy I thought like with lots of money and attitude I thought like he'll make a machine for himself
you know yeah so in the starting also we establish that Freddy and all that they leaning to that
box they were eating so we established properly from the first scene even the
underwear irritation and all that so that you know there extend away so that plantings was done properly so that
you'll not feel suddenly because we reaching to the interval right you know so few films we see that reaching the
climax they rush so what is that underwear irritation scene my brother
who's a producer on this film he live he lives in us for this film he came back and he's doing two and four he's shling
between us and Bombay he he produced arent as well right yeah yes yes so he always used to say what is the problem
in India the detergents you know the texture is going wrong I used to think what he saying is true because because
because the detergent and the water uh the use softners also for the water that all there but we don't have it in India
so yes this is something wrong with the detergents of water that remained in me when he complained when he was saying
this like long back 15 years back so I thought like let's put this idea and you
know what like you pull up your socks you know tighten your balls when you're going for a fight so I thought like this
guy taking that guy's underway putting it a camera going like that the drum sound with the marati song I thought
like it would be fully entertaining uh you know moment and tiger and tiger
Triplex tiger so we only designed that brand and we use the tiger sound also on
it right so yeah so it is purely for fun and you know yeah yeah it is mad yeah
it's like why are all those people dressed in animal uh wearing animal masks because I understand ranir is an
animal yeah I wanted to get a little different flashy different effect on it
okay and one more thing what I thought majorly thought was you know whoever the fighters are
whichever film you see the fighters are same right have you noticed yeah I can't cast Fighters see in the film in the
60th birthday party in the classroom scene when ranir picked the rifle I chose every Junior
artist by photographs I have casted literally one by one like I want the
junior artist also to look in a specific pattern and uh look so I can't cast fighters fighters are Fighters
you see the same action guys actually I've seen that even the dancers you see the same yeah when I was a kid I used to
notice especially in wenes songs there used to be one guy who is there for seven eight years for almost 30 songs
the Frontline dancers you know all the faces yeah exactly yeah like that even the
fighters we know a lot of them they they'll be dang they'll be in ch film
they'll be in rajin film and suddenly they'll be in a small set of film also like four CR film also they'll be there
so I thought like how to hide them and this is a a film which is happening in
Delhi so and that to you know that somebody's attacking from a different country he's hiring people no matter in
India but he'll not hire the same faces right the moment you see the Fighter's
face I felt like you lose the real realness of it right uh the authenticity
of it so I thought like how to do that I thought like well let's cover let put Monkey C
idea was a monkey cap first monkey cap is regular let's make animal B title is animal
so I told to Sur and Sur got it designed and uh it took a while we actually a
time there that we have pushed the uh you know uh this interval for another 20
25 days because the masks were getting ready because I was thinking like I I I
I definitely feel it wouldn't have worked the way it is working looking now if I show the faces yeah the fact that
they are autonomous makes it a little more uh scary in a way it's like a
little don't yeah because face you know the expression with the A and all you see the but this like some everybody has
the same expression yeah yeah know when they're turning and when is doing this calling it looked very scary because you don't see them yeah like like a joker
mask so I thought it will best for the film you know or else you see if you
have faces also now you feel like right there's no expression the
people are dying so you didn't really feel B fight actually it helped the the
length of the fight fight yeah yeah again I don't know if this is intentional or you're going to say I didn't think of it but all your bad boy
Heroes they high Achievers one is a super surgeon one is a spacecraft
engineer in animal what is that I don't know uh it's just a professional that
you think yeah I think U maybe I want my heroes to do best everything they're
doing I don't want I don't know I never thought also actually okay the topper of the college topper of the University I
never thought it just came while was typing the dialogue I don't know so that's what it's like it's a flow yeah yeah it comes from the unconscious yeah
yeah basically maybe I love to deal with smart guys maybe know like messed up smart
guys there are some lines in your in your films like uh here there's a line that happiness is
a choice happiness is a decision a decision yes in Arjun there's this this this lovely line that says suffering is
personal it's not the suffering is that's all that's one thing but also there's this lovely line that uh arjun's
dad says flash hurt yeah it's not the good boys that H is the flashbacks that follow these are your lines or are these
are they like things you've read long back I heard somewhere must have heard I didn't but suffering is personal
happiness is a decision I felt it right I felt and and I WR but that line I read somewhere basically I'm asking are these
your philosophies I believe in them yeah I definitely believe happiness is a decision yeah it comes within us only
and if you really want the environment should not affect you you can be happy always right tell me about the timing
decision for two things one is where the title animal appears yeah and two is
when the hero Reveals His Name these are two very specific decisions that you've
taken yes why did you say I want this at this point and I want that at that point so actually uh when when I was thinking
how the film is going to begin I didn't find a point where I have to put title right or else it will feel like okay now
everybody know that you're coming and watching animal why you should push saying that okay now see the title I
didn't find a space first thing another thing I felt it will be so cool playing that Orchestra kind of a music after
killing and they eating and quietly it will settle with like a step pencil and
with a gunshot the gold is filled I thought like that's a very powerful image people clapped at that point yeah
I thought I was like dreaming because suddenly some some special effect kind of thing started coming start SL it
fades in the circle out Circle and the Inner Circle yeah so I thought uh that will be a nice way of presenting the
title and name I because every time he because he loves
his father so much I always wanted him to say b s and even in the Press they
say that the first time we hearing a third generation entrepreneur not willing to take his
name calls himself balir sing Kaba I don't know how much it is heard while he was going to pin so when it
comes and even when he says to his rash's
brother all the time is saying n n name and all that audience will
feel I think that's a way of holding attention on a different aspect with the
story drama music everything there's another line I thought which which will be nice for the audience to hold it and
give it at a point where you feel with that PGM when you
hold down and saying the echo I thought like that's
where you know I thought it's a very you know cinematic High as for the character also I feel like it's a nice reveal yeah
because we we given like three four situations where you feel even the cousin say like by so Nam even even the
father also never calls him vij in the climax only rashmika says vij I'm leaving you yeah VI when he stops
him only twice we hear his name that in the climax and throughout I maintained
in the dialogue that nobody calls him with the name right so I thought that's a nice uh way of of uh people they're
thinking while you're watching the film that's nice way to make the audience think right okay now comes one of my
favorite things in the movie The doubling when Anil does not come home on his birthday Anil kapor does not come
home on his birthday the child ranir goes to his mother and asks uh she says
your dad is so busy we'll have to clone him yeah but he says not clone make a body double
later he actually makes a body double of his father yeah and much later somebody
makes a body double of him of ranir at the end right there's this other thing where abr's wife gives birth to
identical twins like like that's what they say right at the middle of the fight what is this constant doubling
going on no because that's this see this is deliberate like as you asked you wanted do it or it's unknowingly it's
very deliberate because uh because one thing I feel like fifth fourth standard
cloning or body double that's always a thing to ask but I thought like it's okay maybe he understood that so
probably a super smart guy or something yeah so maybe he understood cloning at that point in '90s
so uh I thought we'll give the idea of body double and hit it which is a nice planting and payoff yeah and in the
climax why I uh because see he's Abus see Bobby deol's marriage and everything
is actually domestic abuse yeah marital rape call it anything you know you know
but when you see they are not willing to reveal the details about where he has
gone I found very fascinating when when I was thinking about the scene that
he's ill treating is a small word to say but they are giving him that respect and
all that even she's having a labor pain she's not willing to take you know where he has gone
so I thought when the cousins come because they are loaded guns in the flight and they're going to kill and why
this fist fight is happening why to shoot you are 12 people and there have four people that's what the Royal comes
and he say then he'll
say said when he says that for the effect of it I did it's like that that
women has delivered a baby boy instead of saying twin you know twins identical twins this is the emotion to it when you
say it and Bobby doesn't know about that so while I was making it editing it for
me emotionally there's a shift towards Bobby I actually shifted while I was editing I like why you killing him I got
that feeling and most of the audience also felt yeah I spoke to a lot of people they felt that for a moment we were on the Bobby's side yeah because of
this aspect because if you see revenge is Revenge end of the day you know he also wants to emotionally same you're
doing for your father he doing for his grandfather so yeah so I thought like in
when you say identical twins I I felt like it is doubled the emotion is doubled yeah two kids are going to be of
now right there another eight kids so it will be like you are worried about your father
one son imagine there are eight kids yeah yeah and you don't know what's going to happen that's what Sur G will
tell grandfather you just forget about this right away here yeah then he says like
uh you know something like that actually that's when I got the idea that there's
probably going to be a sequel because when he said like I was like okay this looks like something that's going to
continue but that's amazing because you set up when ranir is a kid the point of
the body double the payoff comes at a very unexpected point when the dad is
shot and he creates this this body double and that's like like seriously uh
think now again you could have without the setup itself you could have still had say I'm creating a body double
because everything is Extreme anything is possible so he could have still done that what made you say I want to set it
up then as a child set up this body double concept as when the child is still there yeah I thought I just wanted
to you know show that he a smart kid he's able to gauge that you know that
okay father's a busy man I'm okay with it right you know because the way he's emoting also no matter what Papa just a
queing his mother is shocked the way he's saying cloning
she's like Whata going to deep detail and K is
going to the factory right so I thought that just to give that you know strong
intention and give that smartness thing uh and it's nice know that it's unfolding and it's planting and paying
off yeah plan and pay office is really really like at at at the most unexpected moment so that's what really works like
the other doubling is there's this there's this twice it com
like then reverse it and then the next janum finally you will learn from this
janum and you will become the ideal Papa and I will become the ideal beta tell me
that that Jan Jan you're saying that this will always happen like never end
see there's way of explaining when you say it when you talk
in a way if at all you little mad on the topic you say h you say it in such a way when it happens if if if if is always
there but there's no if in this if you notice in the
line so I I felt while I was removing the ifs in the dialog felt like it's
very new he so sure the shity of having a Janam Janam is showing that the vast
love you know you know how much he loves his father to what extent right shows
that it's a little um uh you know like uh very stupid to say like agum AG what
nonsense you're saying nobody knows what happen agum but in a very um what you
say very poetic way uh you're so sure of three four uh lives so that shows that
depth of a relationship that's why I used as a first publicity thing uh to say like what this story is going to be
like two years back we left audio teaser saying this this like of the audio teaser so just give a idea to the
audience that it's a story about Father and Son yeah for me the most interesting visual in the film is you go to an
extreme closeup of ranir with a beard and uh you know like
like there then it's almost like the a screen lifts and like if you stop
halfway you see a beard you still see ranir here and then when the screen fully lifts you see it's actually Bobby
yeah one did you cast Bobby because he kind of looked like R I don't know I'm just like asking is uh no okay okay it
was just an inspired bit of casting that's it it's just why not Bobby do yeah yeah I saw one of the picture CCL
car celebrity cricket league he was holding a water bot and looking into the ground I really loved the expression I
show it to Bobby sir also so this is the reason I've come here like you know showing the picture right so yeah that's
that's I always wanted like I I want the audience to wait se's
you know how the health is going down and wa to a point where maybe he's imagining things there's nobody actually
I didn't want to open in the casting that there's Bob deal in the film this thing for me I felt I'll not
let the world know that there's bobel in the film but today's thing it's very hard to hide yeah when you're not hiding
then then let's put a poster also because I want my willing to be revealed oh this is what it is yeah I
couldn't give that because digital information we can't hide things only unless you do it in a studio
completely but the beautiful thing about that is it positions them as like almost
like twins like two sides of the same cont and when you're saying brothers so
all this was in mind but still it worked knowing because when I was writing I thought nobody knows this Bob in the
film yeah and I'll open like that and the high is bit four five times than what is it now in the Thea but now but
still it worked because my fear was that only because when when when I was shooting the idea was that but by the
time I reached to the location then it's it's out even in the audio teaser also I
was thinking whether to put Bob's name or not but I thought like if you hide today anyway it's going to people will
know that he's there so let's use his name right and another thing is this guy cannot hear yeah that guy cannot speak
yeah yeah that that again was a yeah yeah yeah because uh because there's one
line actually when tripti confesses to him and when he says like I knew the day one
you are she she actually uh you know she'll curse him there a lengthy dialogue I removed it I didn't shoot
only she'll say like you know what's the diff this there's no much difference between you and your brother the
difference is like he's mute and you're deaf it it will come in a very powerful way when she's saying I thought like
let's not use this we'll use in the climax because so much of punching is happening so obviously that goes away
yeah so he's trying to talk and his brother will say and his brother will say I knew that people will laugh and I
felt for a while that Hing the emotion might come down but the music is so high
so nice those lyrics are so it was holding yeah they laughing at the same time they are like into the emotion of
the you know actually I wasn't laughing I was I was actually very moved because
uh that's one of the rare times I don't know if I've ever seen a fight scene where you you have such an emotional
song happening usually you have again that's that's the music cues that you give right they very off very uh off the
beat and track so sometimes it takes us a while to process because we're used to
like like I said sad scene means violent you know happy scene means this but here it's a fight you're not going like
fullon you know electric guitar or whatever it is to Rouse the emotion you're making it sound like a very
emotional event that's happening there's a chorus to the chorus yeah how did you
decide that that was going to be a very emotional moment day one I was having this idea that and the hero and the
villain comes into the picture first the first time looking at each other and if you see R we'll be seeing like oh this
guy this is what I was waiting for he gives that so I wanted like you know in
the climax when the lovers meet there's always you know always you know like a
symphony kind of a music he's playing I thought why don't we use it for the hero and villain yeah and it's a Punjabi song
and it's saying about relationships about father predominantly so I thought sorry that will work even that's
why I was because I was playing uh in in my in my phone it's playing like that and I was watching in
the Monitor and there's another speaker also which is playing for the actors so
I was very keen we were very close uh tis when po coming down R is coming down
and they're looking at each other and walking towards like that it's a old scene we've seen hundreds of films
sharar but I thought that that song and that placement and in between they're talking he's stopping the cousins and
he's stopping his brothers yeah that you know equally we want to fight and the ethics were same from both the sides so
and villain is not playing uh dirty yeah he also have that equally thing like I you know I'm going to take him down so
all that worked yeah and in the middle you're getting that information about identical twins yeah yeah and they're
exhausted and smoking also all that really worked it was very uh is it true
that you wanted a kiss to happen between rir and yeah actually yeah actually there's a kiss he'll heill kiss who will
kiss uh Bobby will kiss ranir okay but it was superb on the shooting what kind
of kisses it it'll kiss on the cheek when he says like by you know you'll I didn't even spend one day with my father
if you you say you say uh you're leaving it and I'm going to leave you and he's
he's convincing him and he'll come and kiss on the cheek and he'll go back and open the zip so that it was nice but
with the music and before he low the zip yeah okay I felt like Kiss is diluting the zip so I thought why I removed it
because Bobby are expression he just gives a smoke like that and you see a tears going I felt that is more bigger
cinematic High than coming and kissing so I thought like I got through that tear ear rolling and that smoke he
gives what you saying you did so much to my brothers and now you're saying forgive me I'll go away it's not
going to happen so when he's still talking he'll take two steps back and he'll open the zip and then run R
figures out that you know he's not going to keep for now yeah and I like that zip moment because it again goes back to the
monkey story yeah yeah yeah yeah you know yeah so that's like everyone's this
equal anim out there like like like they're all behaving the same same way
there's a clear indication that willing is putting the zip is saying like
that sometimes entire heroism might die in the climax what happened but the way
rir looks at it like that and even he's having tears and he removes a cap of the
knife it really went the way is taking the turn the nice Sunset is happening yeah all that really helped the scene
like super there is one thing I'm very curious about uh again between Arjun RI and here
in Arjun RI you begin not begin opening scene is that two people by the sea but
when the grandmother starts talking uh you have a bhagat Gita uh Sanskrit
schloka yeah yeah that that that that talks about time right in Kabir Singh
it's a Kabir Doha which talks about time here again there's in uh animal there's
there is again that Kabir Doha at the point where the fight is happening tell
me about this bits of ancient philosophy that you put into your movie this is this uh because sidat garima wrote
dialogues for Kabir Singh so sidat understands telu so the kind of bhagat
Gita thing I used and now it's titled Kabir Singh so it's their idea that we use Kabir do uh in the beginning and the
end it will go with the title also and but in animal uh uh it's it's not
deliberate I don't know how because I always wanted to me and sorup thought like you know he's the bigger bad guy
than everybody yeah he's saying basically I looked inside myself and there was no one worse than me yeah
right yeah so why is he telling it that at that point because you you bought the machine out and you are like you know
you know how the they're flying like ants you know right so I thought before getting there I think this line will
work with that smokey effect that yellow light right so yeah initially we thought we'll use it in the quar before firing
then after that uh we used it there so another uh not lines but bit of music
that you use is like when Arjun R sees PTI for the first time you use a song
that's a goddess song yeah yeah yeah right yeah in so when ran sees ganali uh you use Ro
that's Ro that thing is it's like a love song to a like a woman placing her on a
pedestal right what is that that introducing the girl with that song yeah
it is it is not a deliberate thing but thing is uh big fan of uh rman work yeah
especially Roa bomb and all that and uh I want it to sound uh very real because
they are partying in the ground floor on on the top of the roof there is a engagement happening so more than the
background score I wanted to use on the atmospheric sounds FY background sounds sounded very real then I thought like uh
let's use this uh rman s song because the trior band who created this song
they were in Arjun R audio function who came and they playing the band okay before the crowd you know started
walking and sitting so they were playing few tracks I was like who are these guys
since then I was having I was in touch with them I was watching their videos so
then I found this Zan song and then I contact them I said like I want to use this as an introduction from the bike
from I started in the classroom itself time so so I I like the idea of using a
sound some in a particular uh place and you come to the nucleus where it
actually started I like that idea I don't know why but uh but it's uh it's not deliberate that I want to use music
when I'm introducing the hero right uh the idea was to be like very question because you made only two films so it's
like but it's but because it's happening I'm asking so yeah no it's okay because I I I wanted it to be more real more
realistic yeah that's that's the only idea right right and uh it's such a famous track I thought immediately you
are into the story yeah that music will help you know four five times more than a regular uh mean if I would have asked
ramesar to give a background score it wouldn't have worked the weight is working with ro because the Nostalgia
always helps helps yeah and it's plus set in that time and yeah yeah yeah okay you're going to kill me for this but
again in both your films there's an intercast marriage yeah okay you didn't notice
this either yeah intercast this the interstate intercast yeah it's not a
signature n i mean it just happened yeah because
uh because this I I see a lot of uh and Tamil family settled in Delhi right so
it just uh yeah maybe I like seeing inter you know region marriage intercast
I mean one of the biggest highs in the movie is when she they're sitting in
front of her family and uh they don't say anything but they kiss and the music
of Who Am starts right it's like the Prelude of H starts and then that that wonderful electric guitar that sound
goes it's such a wonderful rock song yeah yeah and then you kind of take off into that zone I want to know why did
you choose like why did you and your composer choose that to be a rock kind
of like there's a recklessness in it there there is a recklessness in the Rock because it could have been a melody
song also right it's like a yeah yeah you you you feel it's it's voicing out your rage and it's very Rebels yeah it's
it gives a very young feeling they're very uh you there's a bit of negligence also in that you know uh this is what we
are you know so I thought like after coming from such a big drama of what's happened between him and his father 60th
birthday G sister everything after we see what he has done in the school I felt like he should not explain himself
I wantedly made him sit in such a way that they already he heard a lot from
them but we as audience we were only listening a little end part of it you
know I just wanted that to happen the brief was like like you hearing this from 10 minutes you understood that they
are not going to understand whatever we try to explain them so let's give them
you know that most unexpected thing to see after that there's no talk how to how to shed them yeah please don't talk
like that we are really in love from the childhood you can't you he'll never say that even the girls will never maybe you
know because he's stunn on it so I thought this is a nice you know it's a nice takeoff point
from there so when you guys sat down to compose you knew it was going to be a rock song yes yes yes when I because uh
pram are composed it when I braved him also uh I I said like I wanted to be
like that I wanted to have those you know that uh passionate voices in
between when uh this guitar and this is happening because I told him the scene this is what it will be in the flight
and all that right it will be rebeling in front of the parents and going away in a way it's not running away but very
elegantly getting up and walking out you know you you know so I that I I explained him and uh this happened in
the pandemic actually this brief happened in the zoom call and yeah right and then it's like they're on the ground
next minute in the sky yeah it's like on straight you know yeah yeah so you know you say soulmates and when you're in the
flight you always say like you know so many Souls on the board there's a little symbolism in that I don't know how many people understood it I thought this this
was a brief for pram sir you know when I narrated him you have a very good sense of Music yourself or do you explain very
well what you want are you so specific because every single song that you've
had has really worked in this nobody knew what Jamal Kuru was and it's like now it's now viral Arjun nobody like
like that's become a a thing like is this all no because I I listen to a lot of music uh uh I can't imagine myself
without music even I can't write a scene without music and sound at least at least I have you when you're writing you
play something all all the time no I I have to know like what kind of a music in the background or if not music what is the atmospheric sound whether it is
set in a low roof house or a high roof I don't know why it's a pain actually because it will stop your writing if you
don't get that Clarity and so what I have inculcated the Habit after you know doing some short films in austral in my
film School whenever I'm writing a screenplay I have a mood material like if even Arjun had I collect some
photographs random photographs which I think I can see Arjun r in it I collect
few photographs I collect some music pieces writing job you is like self motivation yeah yeah yeah you have to be
motivated all the time it's not easy wor because one week you right after that you might lose interest so to keep
yourself motivated on the subject point I collect some audio and some
photographs so like that I collected a lot of music for animal I started collecting during Kabir
only I'm I'm shooting Kabir but something if I see I feel like it's going to for my next film I immediately
take it and put it in you know save it in the computer or a phone so this song
this a Persian song I selected it like 4 and a half years back so randomly one
day in between the shoot I visited my uh folder my mood material of animal I scrolling scrolling up I found one music
piece I said like wow this is what I thought for Bobby the's introduction then luckily we got the
permission and we red it a little remastered kind of a thing we did and we used it working because sometimes when
you're deeply involved in the story you you know very well whether you want a real sunlight or you want uh you know
just afternoon light or a morning light that that it's just a feeling there's purely no calcul purely feeling and uh
that's how it happened and I'm maybe I listen to a lot of music and specifically I'll tell them this is
what I wanted I think that's why every time every song every bgm is standing out because I'm very clear with what
sound I wanted right right and you're also trying to break the cliche of the of yeah because you know if you remember
when the Father and Son discussion is happening there's a siren used when he says
uh seeing at the 15year old's rage saying he'll go to jail there's one
siren I used where an will be going back like that that siren and the mement in the frame is in the sink yeah it sounded
like what a piece of thing you know music is playing at that point so even when uh even the theme the visil theme I
use with that you know uh I use it like I know how how what do you call that
instrument that will come like that that visual theme Papa's Papa's theme I use it like a rage thing now you know so
like that yeah yeah I think I'm very
specific maybe that's the reason yeah right right why did you want to make abrar a Muslim see I thought I'll tell
you because I feel I've seen people when when they hit to a zone of zero
confidence people will come and uh you know uh say that go to uh the church or
go to some Baba he'll give you some tabis change your name things will work for you things like that happen we have
I've seen people changing their religion because so much has happened to them that yeah in a low point they feel like
it's a new birth the change of identity completely so I felt when the other grandfathers
kicked out of swastic I thought he's done somebody must have suggested
him so I thought like we see a lot of people converting into Islam and
Christianity we never see anybody converted to Hinduism yeah so we we see a lot happening in the surroundings so I
thought like I'll use this because in in Islam there's multiple uh times you can
get married so I can have multiple cousins with different faces the drama will be bigger that's the only reason
yeah there's nothing like you know okay you're a Muslim I can show you know bad light or you can show it like a villain
yeah because few people are writing you know like why you you made Muslim as a villain no I was just curious because
you have a sik protagonist or or a Punjabi and then I was just curious about the line because just like I'm curious about why they go to church uh
that scene with the church it's like uh because when things like that happen people suggest like you know that's what I said now go to that Baba go to this
church and uh even even that hom which is happening it's purely South Indian thing yeah so I thought like uh you know
when somebody is sick at home you try to seek blessings or speak spiritual things
from every possible religion so it it depends on what kind of a family you
strictly you don't want to see any other religion then you'll only strict to Hinduism right so I thought like a father is like open guy so I thought
like okay let's go to church let's go to there here there so that's the reason I use Church like let's cure this guy yeah
like you home home happened immediately Church happened everything is happening and that's why you see an G is looking
at him he's saying amen amen and all that you know and also that that home home there's a nice touch because rashmika is familiar with that with that
concept saying hold this do this do that there's one line the cousin
says so I thought there's no need of the dialog I chopped it in the edit I thought like it's understood the way
she's asking him to do it's understood why say it again with that that and rest
of them are just standing is there but he don't know the ritual how it works why does he
tell ganali like uh if I die don't
remarry I see in a relationship uh sometimes you know most of the times I
feel uh in in relationships you are done the rest will be a habit multiple
partners could be habit once you are with one person the share of love with that particular person you are done for
the life you know that could be the exchange between ganali and ranay and knowing the psyche of ganali there's so
many things in a relationship which is unsaid so he must have felt that you can't make it with anybody else so you
better remain single so because knowing her mother and parents they might suggest to if I don't
come back that okay now happened is happened after maybe after 2 3 years they come and tell you that no let's get married and he doesn't want
his kids to be seeing ganali with another father maybe that's his thought
yeah it has nothing to do with a generalized feeling it's between it's purely personal so I know that because
people looked at especially the Pudo fist looked at it saying uh oh he can go and sleep with another woman but he
doesn't want her to uh you know marry again I found it very funny but because
I'll tell you to to to an extent they they felt like why is he introducing pry
in a White costume CU he want everything to be fair but this fell is I don't know
that uh this angle of how they dissect your film is gone from Arjun from Kabir
to now in this four years the meter has gone up somewhere like it's it's too toxic now
no it's it's also I think these are the very unique things that make the films
extreme because like you say the drama comes from the from the fact that you're pushing the material right and I was
like one of the things that that that I really like about your films is that
they they kind of really push you provoke you shock you they move you uh
they do everything like usually when you see a love story for instance you're like I want to be
moved but you're giving like all these other uh like things your your kind of
like the the this is one big Tali of emotions that you're that you're giving and I'm not prepared for it like because
it's like so it's like watching somebody without a filter you know like uh that's
refreshing because usually people always like look through a film with or a
character with just one gaze and here you're like like you're just like I'm going to do what feels right at that
moment for that character rather than like try to you know do this whole thing
in a certain way and I think that's very refreshing uh to watch in a film to have a villain for instance for just 20
minutes I think it's unheard of because it's like usually what the the traditional way of of of of thing is you
introduce the hero maybe either you introduce the villain or you wait for like uh something interval point or
maybe Midway somewhere so that people know that okay there is is an antagonist that is going to kind of a thing but
here he kills his brother-in-law at that point he introduce the villain's brother we don't even know who that chap is when
he dies there's a phone call and that is when the brother dies there's a phone call and then you realize oh there's
somebody else and then there is this uh explanation about the family and then
the villain is revealed the actual villain it's like a it's a very different way of writing that's what I'm
talking about and uh thinking that audience are with you yeah is one very scary uh ride if if they lose one or two
bits they'll not follow but how do you what is this conviction that you have S it's like you're you're doing everything
against like like what is usually done like what is this conviction that
you have how do you get this this because we we we are very clearly I'm very clearly underlining things right
which it's it's not easy that that you will not notice it you have to notice it
you're making it uh very uh thickly underlined everything that is one thing and another thing is I don't know the
other way the other way bows me the thing is if if I don't make the flight go up like that see all that mountain
all that CG thing so many hundred meetings with that just to give that high of a takeoff in a story then what
way would be to jump into screenplay like just putting after 8 years it's so boring it's it's because when you see
like oh what where where this is going and suddenly you see range row and suddenly this I'm not giving time to you
to think so I feel very much I'm holding the attention so I thought like all this
Snippets what you said phone call brother yeah reveal I thought they are always with me right so but at the same
time sometimes you feel what if they don't really bother about a storytelling then you are dead I used to get this
feeling in Arjun also why I have to look at your story why is he pissing you in pants
move on with your life what if audience think like that but the whole idea of making a film is to you know I'm going
on a ride just follow me throughout the ride yeah that's what a strong screenplay is always right right that's
a challenge and that's a that's the only way to do it right right I want to talk about the Zoya character again because
you don't explain every little bit in your in your movie but just give enough hints there is this uh with gitanjali
uh she shown in a very like almost like a very chased virtuous manner like like
like even after the love making or whatever she's coming in a sar like a bridal SAR kind of a thing and all these
kind of things whereas with Joya you actually see her like naked and uh he's
resting uh on her hips so that image how did you like conce that image
that you want to show a 180° difference yes yes I want to show the difference difference and uh and one more thing is
uh uh obviously there's a little nudity in it but I don't want I didn't want to
sound SAS I want the audience to see like to what happened why is he going to
that extent like you know because the the way they come close close and C to I want
that shot actually then when I saw in the edit it's not working then I use the casing
shot yeah so the sh value so I just use that kissing shot and next when the
music goes High I use that tracking shot then when I explained to ranir and trp
also I said like it will look like a painting it will not look like it did look like a painting actually because it's almost like a still life you they
they're not moving at all yeah only the cigarette smoke is moving like that yeah it was a deliberate it's like they're
lost just to give a feeling that you know suddenly what happened what is this
new love story and from there within no time I want to get to a point where she'll open the
backstory so when he says like I knew the day one that you are this then there's a question that he
would have threatened her but knowing the fact if you threaten she'll not open yeah so you I want to you have to seduce
yeah I thought like you you gone to that level also that okay I'll get this out
so yeah it is it is actually layered very deep it will be nice to see in the part two Park yeah I think yeah because
yeah yeah because because when you see if you have you noticed when she says now go and kill
her she's always saying you murdered so many people now she's [Music]
going and I felt even the bootlicking scene also I didn't want to piss
somebody or I didn't do it to irritate somebody it's like I felt I knew that you're a mole I knew that you have come
here to do something wrong to me but to kitabi how much of acting you had I felt
there is one little side of ranay he you know there's a moment yeah you
can't say you're fully acting there's a moment of you know see she thought she'll cheat you but she gave up but you
know that she came to cheat you but you are double cheating her you know and at one point you also as a man you
understood that she's really giving it that you know that warmth or whatever you know so there there is a mild
connection which he doesn't want to accept in front of the wife maybe he also hates the fact that he got a little
connected with Zoya so that's why when she opened up why did you say that lick
my shoe because she said I really love you and I can't handle your hatred I saw
how much you love your father you
know because I love you so much AA then uh lick my shoe because why he wants to
prove because I that's a very fine line showing that you also got connected yeah
that's why you are trying to test her I don't know how many people understood that right but most of them thought oh
God he's asking her to lick the shoe it's not point is not that point is unknowingly you connected you enter
into a very dark world now it's going to screw you up completely that's what I want to show but whatever it is we'll
see in the part two but this is a nice planting which I thought it's a very fine way to do it right but most of them
thought about the boot looking only they never thought about the emotion it's for me it was the equivalent of like yeah
you love me okay jump out of that window yeah you know like do something extreme like like uh because at that moment he's
like he's pissed off that she's saying oh I love you still whatever it is after doing all this and he's like this is an
extreme he's because he takes his leg away when she comes so he takes his leg away so it's like it's not like he
really wanted but it's like more like saying okay if you really love me jump out of the window or you know some some some random thing that's yeah it's a
test or rather he's kind of that irritated that that that moment has come about yeah yeah that's why he'll tell to
his cousin s Pana yeah that's that's a warning that warning is coming out of
you see no matter what you have a feeling that because of you I found my
uh you know uh Destiny yeah yeah so I know know where to go and what to do so
it's that's why I think he'll say I can't kill her right so she why you love her so that became more complicated
there right so do you see ranv as a misogynistic person see actually I don't
know most of the misogyny is disrespect to women right the actual definition of
is that right to name even Kabir Singh even animal even me as a person I always
feel like my picture production name is badali picture I know why people think that I is people not too many only this
15 20 Jokers but it's a wrong wrong word to use on Kabir and animal you know what
what do you think I want to ask you right you think it's a misogynistic character Kabir Singh or Arjuna or this
guy no I'll tell you what I I feel right see the thing is because the characters are so overheated and because the world
is so overheated everything is so extreme I I I wouldn't apply the normal
rules of the world to this world right see for example in this movie uh he says
I slap you he she she says if you slap me I'll slap you right back or something like that you know like like kind of a
thing by the way did that line come about because you wanted to no no no it came here he didn't want to address your
because I I thought like she she she's a girl I'll slap you yeah but I'll slap you first yeah so I'm I'm like see
because the characters are so extreme uh for me in your films the rules of the normal world don't
apply really and that's what's good about it because it's like see for example if you read books like uh like
wding heights and all those Gothic novels right it's this passion that is so like overpowering and all those kinds
of stuff that it's like those people don't really they'll seem like to others they will seem like mad people but only
they will know what that that passion or whatever that that thing is so for me
it's like it's like literally like watching through a glass wall people who
look like us but behave in this very passionate intense Manner and for me
what also like I know I get into a lot of discussions about this where people disagree with me but where I see this is
your Heroes always end up paying for their mistakes whether it's Arjun Rd he
loses the girl and uh he ends up messing up his career he's forced to accept his
mistake uh he goes through a long period of self-reflection self-realization things on things like that he gets to
the a bottom of a pit because he loses is that girl it's like and then he has to lift himself up again and make
himself worthy of getting her it's only after he tells the medical board that
yes no I'm not going to take a refuge in a lie I'm going to admit that I did a mistake because enough is enough it's
only then that after that that he meets prti till then he's not meeting prti like like when he's still in that
horrible I'm a rock star face it's only after he realizes mistakes that he's meeting pry this is how at least I I see
it right and everybody's probably seeing it differently yeah similarly here at the end for all the things that he does
his father is still going to die his wife goes away it's like he loses his uh
hearing he's like it's not like like they pay for whatever like there's a
kind of Redemptive aspect right so for me not Redemptive that's a wrong word but what I'm trying to say is that so I
don't see it as a uh I see it has these characters in this particular movie and
uh I guess it also has to do with how people see movies because some people see movies as okay if you see this movie
then it impacts people outside in society uh I see it as this is a story
being told within this Frame and I have to enter that world to understand those
characters that's as simple as that yeah I I don't know I know that that a lot of people are going to find a problem with
what I just said but that's that's the way I process F but this too much of
analyzing and scrutinizing films started off late right past 10 years before I
don't know but I think it's I think it started slowly but don't you think it's a good thing because it's like you get to hear different sides see yeah get to
hearing different sides is different but completely without knowing the context out of context May s few things you see
and see see I I've heard somebody saying like now he's the hero of the film
asking a girl to makes a girl to lick his shoes that's a wrong because he
never made her to lick yeah yeah yeah and even when you know when she you know
the pregnant woman is threatening her that he's going to shoot so all that they say it in a very different context
but the context of the film is different yeah I'm talking about that having a conversation you know people having a
different point of view is always great yeah because it is affecting the whole idea of art art up discuss but I think
it's it's it's good because it's like see I see it this way somebody else sees it some other way somebody else sees it
some other way and I think like that that way that's fine but I feel that that's totally fine because because the
main uh aim of the art is Art will definitely upset people which my understanding of it is but playing a
different context is different now because having a different point of view criticizing I love people criticize it
because okay you understood this way but interpreting in a wrong way is my problem so that's that's a see if you
don't see the movie and you comment about it or then that's the problem definitely that's a that's a I think
it's okay to not like a movie but at least watch it properly and understand and then dislike it or whatever it like
yesterday we spoke thinking that nobody talks about the craft because I've seen
people this growing numbers only talking about the how he's misbehaving with the
women and the your review is over I mean like this is they're taking it too personal maybe because I'm I watch
so many violent films I didn't find animal particularly violent exactly what
kind of world Cinema we see the dark films we see yeah it's like because I've seen
very very dark disturbing viol like if you see saw uh or all those movies those are like those mess you up for days this
is not a old boy old boy yeah this is not I for me at least but then again you know for somebody who Maybe Who has not
seen those films this is a violent film I think it's also the exposure and and other things no they're exposed I don't
know but only they are very particular when it comes to Indian film because I've seen people talking reviewing great
things about Joker and wolf of the Wall Street what I feel very funny is I can understand random people talking about
it even reviewers are talking about it okay I've I've seen people in the industry who are actors you know the
directors you know attacking other persons uh a film it's very I mean I'd like to know
first yeah you have proved people wrong by saying by making the biggest box off
his successes right but why does this bother you so much no that's what I'm saying see I'll tell you my point is
like why can't you just say okay they're not understanding the movie The Way I intended it and that I can say to a
person who saying like I didn't like the film right but you are misinterpreting the film is there some part of you that
says I want people to kind of really understand where I'm coming from no I'm saying like if you don't understand also
like see the everybody takes it in a very different way it's it's hugely populated country right but I'm saying
like you belong to the film industry and not understanding this is like I feel you wantedly doing this right because I
I see that that this is deeply bothering you in some way does this like affect your writing for instance do you do you
not at all not at all you think it affected I'm asking you yeah I I don't I don't think so right yeah because when
you're when I'm seeing animal I'm seeing a very free mind yeah yeah yeah yeah like I'm not seeing somebody putting
boundaries and like like I'm seeing a very free mind when I see the screenplay of animal yeah so but that's good yeah
yeah yeah that's good yeah it's always good yeah to have a free mind when you write and make films it's not like yeah there is one part of this film that was
very interesting among many other parts was which is like when he addresses the workers at the factory yeah which is
actually the one place where he's letting go of of or rather like the fury
that has been building up inside him that's exploding at that point to the workers of his Factory yes so what made
you say this is the point that this emotion should come out rather than
maybe at home or maybe with his brother-in-law or maybe with with whatever else a and why did you name the
factory swastic steals because uh auspiciously uh you know it's a very
auspicious title we always do this in our Puja also every time in G that remained in me and I
found it's very nice rhyming altic Ste and that opening thing I always wanted
to put this Factory thing at the furnace right side my there's a lot of furnace
are there like huge Factory and there a lot of crowd than what you see now but it didn't happen because we saw the
furnace but they didn't allow us to go there and do it's too much of heat also actually to have it from a different
distance also didn't let it happen because you have to get the crowd it's tough to control crowd at the furnace
anything can go wrong so we had we got we got a kind of a studio kind of a
thing and we multiplied the crowd and did that and I felt the moment he came
and I didn't want him to behave shout throw things and what has happened instead I want to keep quiet I just want
him to meet the father right because the once he saw the way they was walking and the camera is charging onto anlg I
thought there's a nice you know there's a gap which is getting filled after a long time after that he comes out and I
I deliberately wanted I want his rage to come out through Speech cuz two things are happening one he's motivating them
to go back to your job promising them that I'm going to get my father after 3 months here and throwing the promise to
the even the media is covering it in a way so I thought like four five things are happening in one it's a nice thing
to happen in any screenplay because every time you have to address four different things in world four different scenes our length it's already 3 hour 30
minutes so so that's that's the main thing yeah I kept length also in mind I thought like whatever rage and
everything the rage is coming out in the factory with the furnace in the side it's very symbolically shot I imagine
that way but I didn't get the furn but still it worked and it's also there was a certain uh thing about the Loyalty of
the workers yeah three generations is saying about yeah yeah so that was coming across really well that that's
they hting and all that yeah that they're all like like it's almost like a like a
rally you know that he's that he's kind of kind of a thing and I think what makes it scene really human is that from
that almost like a like that big political speech kind of a thing you cut
to the thing on TV and you show Anil Kapoor's face he's like again like what
is this guy doing or what is he saying and that makes it very human because from a very powerful thing you're you're
seeing now the other other side it's like like like why can't this guy just be like regular and yeah there's one
line actually uh because I didn't want it to shoot like a live I wanted to shoot like it has already happened he's
watching the TV and mang comes and he says I just wanted to say like look at
him he is actually the real successor I want to use that but I thought like there's no
need I thought like I'll not get that so and anyways it's live also so I thought like I you know opted out but uh
I don't know whether you noticed it's like I felt he maybe he's a capable guy maybe he's a real successor of you know
the swastic steel or whatever Empire he has he has a leadership qualities right
more importantly that's a very alpha male scene yeah yeah yeah motivating and all
that and for him to see like he's in us from past 8 years he's just landed yesterday morning morning and
next day he's in the factory he's like you know it's it's not easy to talk like
that you know that he is surprised also and at the same time he's feared also he's getting
scared and there's a dialog actually I I removed that also there's
no need kah want straight show into the fields he going to Punjab so yeah at the
end you said Animal Park yeah uh what was that that that name that name how
did it come I thought like you know know everybody there's bunch of animals now it's not only one or two yeah so it's
it's it's a Warfare now right so so it's a kind of mahabarata now between brothers and cousins and all that right
right did that scene at the airport again the fight between uh the cousins
that is abar and ran VI it looks like one of those National Geographic
documentaries where you know some two animals are are fighting for like our together like they're just going on and
on and on and on and and like there's no kind of until one of them kills the other they're just going to keep fighting kind of a thing is is that
again something that you that you had in mind is yeah because because in the in the usual fight even when you narrate it
to the stand Master also they'll say Sir this is open ground there's nothing to
throw on each other because they they always want some properties to throw on each other so it's it's there's nothing
other than the first fight you have to punch it till somebody dies and both are deliberately saying we don't want
weapons it's it's quite a bit of challenge also for the choreographer to create that right so we got that's why
we we constantly getting ideas of smoking and you know opening the zip and all that having conversation in between
so you know in our Mahabharat and puranas they say know that how much ever
your opponent is cruel you have to give him last one last chance yeah so I thought like maybe he'll ask him because
Grandfather said leave him so he he thought like maybe he'll just take a word from him because I always feel like
um you know my characters always in the film always respect the you know enemy
also opponent also they give equal respect because even in Arjun this is what again I noticed even Arjun he ask
him promise me that you're not going to come back to my girl again then he'll say like you know okay I promise you
this is that Holy scene right that Holy scene so I thought I don't know this is also I noticed after the release
actually I'm comparing what it so he say like you know promise me that you'll not come back again cuz I didn't spend one
day proper day and grandfather said that we are brothers now maybe you also touched you know you
got felt like finally you know your brothers are coming towards you and he's
grandfather clearly says yeah that's a fact actually yeah is
animal part going to be your next film next is uh spirit Spirit yeah that's
that's and uh but you're going to kind of keep working working on on this as
well like animal park no I'll I'll I'll after that I'll work because I don't believe in writers room and all that
multiple writer I write my own stuff I never I mean worked with co-writers I
don't know how that will work I I'll try one day but uh but in this film The there are two writers credited along
with you right oh the screenplay it's a screen scen but story you you screen play because I always discuss with my
brother yeah so is there any point where any of the actors run be or Rika or any
of the actors said why is this happening or what is happening here or or kind of a thing because you know when we watch
the finished product everything is is kind of clear but when you're in it and
when you're making it there may be things that are not because your shoot is always out of syn you're not shooting
in a in order or whatever it is is there any point that that no actually good
that you bought because yesterday night only we were discussing with my ads and my brother there's not even one single
moment in the film in the narration especially with ranir that uh he he
questioned the thought of the film that uh s why do you think this is coming now I don't think so this should this is
right he always tried to you know GAE and understand where this energy is
coming from or why this scene is coming he's always I think there's a director inside him also so because he never uh
uh asked me saying that I don't think so this is going to work like that he always believed in every because I used
to ask him R everything and you are liking is everything okay I'm I'm I was getting doubt on
myself why why is he liking everything why is he not saying anything he I have problem in this problem in that he used
to say like s everything unit is superb it is it is so new so real I never heard
of so it's like you know you know while making only you feel that confidence like you know actor who is so senior he
16 fil old is finding everything new that means story you know is Spirit
going to be another Wild free film I don't know let's see yeah but
I'll be free while writing I I don't uh think about how it has been criticized I think that that should not come because
it will completely deviate from your originality so right now this also means
that you can only choose certain actors with certain image for your movie is
that because maybe not everybody will fit into this world right because some of them might have very like because one
one thing that I read was you're trying to make a love story with Nani no I just
yeah no I wanted to narrate him long back in 2010 but I can't imagine you making a Nani type of love story because
that's a very different Zone yeah yeah yeah but is that something that you had in mind no this is long time back before
my debut I wanted to narrate a story by then Nani was not the same Nani today he was also just just starting new right so
that's a different story that's a different story okay is it true that that for the kind of the zone that
you're interested in the the place or the characters that you're interested in you'll only be able to work with certain
actors with a certain kind of image no nothing like that because but if you see animal it is you you you'll not think
you know andir will fit into this right you know because uh actually that's true because yeah yeah because when he said
yes and when he started getting into the treatment of the scenes elaborating the
scenes it became customized for him because I know he's going to play now
usually what happens is you write then you pitch right this happened in a way that you pitched the idea he liked it and you started getting into the scenes
or t made can give me an example of how you tailored a scene for unbe uh for example uh you know the the factory
scene the walk you know uh you know the simple promise of putting hand like that and turning and you know saying it he he
had his own style of doing it and obviously I added few things and he was
very much ready to adapt into whatever new thing which is coming even the way
he smoking he putting in hand that everything he took it very organically like it was never like I'm pasting it on
him you know it it uh and he did it very effortlessly which is no but I'm asking like is there a scene that that that you
wrote specifically saying I know ranir is going to do the scene so I'm going to write it this way but for example you
know the way he comes in Converses if because it is ranir uh to ganali yeah yeah you're
feeling it more like that even even the action part even the you know viness in
the character because of R R's personal vulnerability helped a lot for this character right you know because it's
it's very unusual for example if this is a story imagine I didn't meet ranir for
the line I wrote the story and when when if I pitched it to you uh you would
always imagined uh a mass hero in this you know you would never
imagined actor from Sanju or jawani diwani will fit into this because I
always noticed in Rockstar and in few scenes where I used to see a great rage
in his eyes right I always used to find this is Action Hero eyes maybe he's doing some romcom you're not feeling it
but when you place him he'll be great this is my personal feeling whenever I saw his films there were few bits and
pieces that they're coming out popping out like hey P the action hero you know it was like that for me so it it worked
I mean yeah yeah all the best for spirit thank you so much congratulations on the
big success of animal thank you and uh I think it's kind of done better than what you expected right yes yes yeah yeah are
you the kind of writer who who also because you said that certain things that you do for shock like for example
cutting from the plane to the car kind of a thing you do keep the audience in mind while you're writing yes yes yes
that's something that you yes that you do that so and I always even in the scenes when I reread it and when I uh
sleep over it I always feel that like we said it in the yesterday interview like I always feel like my my my feeling is
directly uh proportional to the gallery I always feel till now three films it worked let's see for the further films
but I always feel nice yeah so cool all the best for
spirit and thank you so much for the session thank you so much had fun great fun



so good evening this is the big debate that we're having today when a filmmaker makes a film should that film take responsibility for influencing young people and for messaging and for the morality that is putting out or within the sort of um framework of freedom of speech and expression that we all enjoy in this country should filmmakers be allowed to make what whatever film they want.
now to begin with the censor board or or uh the board of film controls actually does a category where it says that okay this film should only be viewed by adult so it should only be viewed by those above the age of 12 or 16 as the case maybe we're talking about the film animal the sense support has decided that it should only be viewed by adults and it's done its job freedom of speech and expression allows the director to make whatever he wants to make and he has decided to make perhaps the most violent film we've seen in recent times but there's been a lot of criticism about the glorification of misogyny the ideas the violence for violence sake that's in this film and the impact that it will have on young people who tend to really mimic and sort of follow what Bollywood shows them which is why we're having this conversation and uh we have like a really cool set of people that we put together uh to sort of understand uh what all of this means in terms of the impact on youth to begin with um one of my favorite people sucharita tagi is a film critic and who sort of been very vocal about films and you know the portrayal of women the portrayal of
relationships towards women the language used and this kind of misogyny that gets glorified so I'm very happy she's had the time to join us KV shria or pops he's commonly known for those of us in the entertainment industry is a veteran hand of at advertising and messaging with a very modern outlook on what's Happening in our society uh Mr Sanji heg is a senior advocate of the Supreme Court and it's I'm really happy that Mr heg decided to join us because there's a legal point of view here as well freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right in India um and with some exceptions so we want to understand um you know if everything in this film is really allowed within that framework nikel tja is the co-founder and the chief of we yua uh he runs this really cool show called uh just be a man where he talks about what it is like uh you know to be a man U and what the expectations are in society and a lot of this film is in that space that NC deals with on his show so he's been kind enough to join us as well thank you all of you for joining us I'm going to start with Sanjay heg because I'm going start the jumping off point of what the law allows us so Mr heg a film that's gory it's violent it's misogynistic it's disrespectful of women um there apparently there is one one scene where he walks into a high school because he feels his sister's being treated badly with a gun and fires it in the air just to send a message does freedom of speech and
expression and the current framework of our law allow for this sort of thing well a freedom of speech has to
mean anything it is freedom of speech for what you do not want to hear or what
you do not want to see popular speech requires no
protection it is unpopular speech that you dislike but you still
have to allow and here the framework as far as films is concerned is set by the
sensor board the sensor board uh looks at uh whatever aspects under its
censorship code and then certifies films for release yes it can't you cannot
require that the sensor board also be a sensor of people's morals or messages
that go out on Films because then you are it's the thin end of the wge
supposing the sensor board says that you know this is not a proposition that the
public at large should be uh subjected to or will will accept the sensor board
is not a sensor of public tastes so if a filmmaker gets his film
certified by the sensor board and it is exhibited in accordance with that there
there ends the debate you are of course free to criticize the film yes that's
also freedom of speech you are free not to view the film all all those things come entire
you are even free to protest outside the theater as far as the film is concerned
without resorting to violence that too is freedom of
speech approach the court saying I find this film too violent you should not be
shown you you could possibly challenge the certification by the sensor board
saying that look if the sensor board had set out these particular norms and
ignored them then that's a pure administrative law question that if you
set out the law and you do not follow the law then follow the law but if the sensor board having a applied the law
then certifies the fill then you can't say that you know it
does not uh fall within my preferred taste or this is not how it should be
allowed just give let me uh conclude by giving you one example these questions
did come up in the Bandit Queen if you remember the film there was a very
violent rape of fand Devi which was shown but that was was integral to the
fandi story yes and you could not have had uh that
film or that impact without that rape scene you you you saw a man's buttocks
bare buttocks on the screen uh as that rape was
committed so possibly that shot could have been uh uh edited by the director
or could have been shot in another another way or shown in another way but that is
the director's Vision it it is the vision of the entire
creative unit and uh that was allowed to stand by the
Supreme Court itself so taste let me this yeah yeah
let me take this question for the rest of our panel yes um SAR I will start with you what is
the problem with the film animal according to you the problem is not the violence the problem is uh not even the
misogyny the problem is not the story the problem is not anything the problem is the Gaze F the problem is the um the
the the justification of of things right we are adults the the sensor board said
that this is a film for adults adults go and watch it uh violence is you it's not
like this is the first time we've seen a human being cut open by an ex it's fine
you know that kind of stuff whoever wants to tell their story tells the story the way they want to tell it and
the conversation isn't about whether someone should be allowed to make a certain kind of film or should not be
allowed to make a certain kind of film we live in a free country that like s said if we start going down that road
it's a slippery slope you cannot tell filmmakers what kind of films they can or cannot
make what this conversation is about is the larger discourse around the film and
the push back criticism of the film um receives it's like there is a status quo
that we must adhere to that this is a movie star and these are big people making his big budget film and his face
still on the stream I'll just take over the show so hey guys welcome this is the saari show
now um yes so anyway until Fay comes back I
can just carry on talking about animal uh so yeah what I was saying to everyone who's here still I face she's back the
question is not about whether sandep should beow allowed to make this film whether ranir should be acting in such a
film the question is about the Gaze with which the film is made and the conversation and the criticism is about
what the film is uh propagating what the film is forgiving of um and what the
film is uh you know meant to uh titilate there's always a way um you know you and you can see it in the in the convers
around the film before it even released uh the intention with which um you know
this story has been put out in the world so that is the larger conversation I would actually I would
actually argue here we watched as kids we watched Rambo um you know first
experience with sort of a machine gun we saw Bruce Willis say y i you know
whatever and then you know jump off a building and fire at people this is which is all you know we all we saw GI
Jo um as as young adults we saw the Joker which was you know which which messed
with a lot of our heads how is that different from this uh pop same question to you do you see a problem with animal
or are you off the view that hey you know what they've made a film don't like it don't watch it no I don't have a
problem um because creative people are free to express you know tell stories it
is no fun um or no brainer uh if you were to not include a twist in the
character um correct it's all about characterization if you actually look at the film it's a one liner relationship
between a son and a father which is boring nobody would go to theaters if you actually say you know the complexity
of the characters and the way they have been portrayed and uh that is what that
is what makes today's stories you know earlier story means a biopic you know from X to Y today know you just take the
complex characters and then you tell a small narrative it's not a story it's a
small event but you dramatize everything else and then the trend of
um actually know lack of story lack of insight lack of something else in uh and
then hiding behind um too much of violence you know too much of uh um of
goriness when it is appropriate it's fine you know as San said you know if it
is you know that that is serious enough to be shown to the audience to get the story and then to get the emotions fine
so there are two things you know one morally uh and then Legally Legally
they fine you know the expert have spoken you know legally nobody can do anything but morally every story writer
you know when they face with a white paper they can write the story which they want to
write correct and this is what um um I'm a member of ASI
board self-governance you know leaving it to the creative people who are writing the stories to their imagination
and then to their own value systems what kind of story you want to write and then how do you want to narrate the story if
you look at you know it started with wasur but wasur did not have as gory
details as it has today uh on OT um but you know somewhere you know the
line needs to be drawn because all the content today um is all set in goriness
you know I have no problem in a torano also does films which has got violence but uh um but it is just a competition
that who can do you know I can chop five fingers and then bloodstream you know
comes out of as five fountains you know we were quite perplexed you know when we saw somebody chopping the head and then
still bloody oozing out of that so now you know it's a matter of you know how many organs you you chop and how many
streams of blood it will come out so we used to have a horror JRE completely When We Were Young you know whether it
is right right correct and then you go and then see this gory thing of hands
being chopped and then legs being chopped it's fine you're mentally prepared to do that but you know there
is something you know which we all do um when we actually do something which influences millions of people and then
we think twice what you want to put and what you don't want to put yeah in fact on that on that note I just want to
bring in um nikil nikel can you tell me now we've talked a lot about and such said it's the Gaze it's the messaging
that we send out it's what we glorify as acceptable behavior um when this person
says U oh you have the hips to Bear an alpha and that is why I will marry you
or um you know earlier the alphas would go out and hunt and the women would look after the children and they would just
marry more alphas and have more alphas and this this whole idea what is from a
social point of view why is that problematic in your opinion you know I'm going to add to
such's point I feel um anyone should be allowed to make any film that they want
right because as Sara said and as Mr s and everyone's been saying over here uh
the moment we start policing what films can or cannot be made uh then we are in a dangerous Society in any case there
are people who file Fs in our country against things that they don't like in
movies so you might have a Bombay bams which is a series where uh you know they've shown a teenager um you know
experimenting with her own sexuality and someone's filed a case against that under posco and um what do you say to
this right and this is just one case I Canan there are many many such cases so uh I don't think that the right way of
looking at any film is to censor or to say that um you know this can and cannot
be made every film is valid as an expression of the filmmaker that is making it and uh the story that they
want to see uh it is the lens that it comes down to and the lens should be seen in not just the context of what the
film represents but also in the context of where we are in uh as a culture where
we are as a society um I I put out a tweet recently that said that the difference between a film about a toxic
character and a toxic film is the intent of the filmmaker um I haven't seen
animal you know I mean I don't have like unlike sucharita I don't have the burden of having to watch every film uh your as
it releases and I can choose not to watch a film that I don't think represents a kind of value system that I want to see on screen uh having said
that I know that the film filmmaker himself s angari has multiple times gone
uh you know in interviews and spoken about that the fact that this film is an answer to his critics this film is made
to make a point this film is made to trigger this film is made to be provocative and when you're are doing um
when you're showcasing something on screen just to make a point to people
who don't like you and that point is being made through misogyny and that point is being made through excessive
violence if that point is being made through a certain value system that tries to Showcase that there is a
certain kind of a man that is cool to watch it's not that the film again you
know and and he's he's playing with us right like because he's called the film animal so the fact is that yes there is
a film where the person the character in it is supposed to be animalistic at the same time the film also has really cool
music it has this banging background music that I you know there's this great soundtrack that is
that it has anytime that there is something problematic that is being shown on screen it is being shown
through a really cool soundtrack which almost goes on to say that you must like
this uh this this moment that you must almost clap at this moment that this is
not an animal moment or a villain moment but a hero moment and then I keep sharing from everyone who's gone on to
theaters to watch this film that they were shocked or maybe POS possibly
unsurprised that people are clapping when a misogynistic line is is being said or they're clapping when something
terrible happens on screen or they're laughing at it and that's the problem with with a film like this right it is
the intent of the filmmaker it is the it is the lens with which this film is being made and it is being done only to
Showcase that I can do this and and you can't do thing about it because if you
do something about it if you complain about it then I can point to all the so to speak woke uh films that you have
made and I can say why is this okay and why is this not okay and that's where we are at and we need to kind of view all
of these films from the lens of unfortunately how they're going to be consumed by a society that anywh at this
point of time believes that you know we are still a very patriarchal Nation we're still a nation that where a lot of
this gender conditioning and a lot of men are being told that uh being Alpha is actually the right way of being or
being an ideal man really means being a bully sometimes being an angry man sometimes you know treating the women in
your lives the way any way that you possibly can Andrew Tate is a huge hero for a lot of people and not just outside
in the world also in India so in a social context like that should we be making films like this just to make a
provocative point just to Showcase that just to trigger uh people who want to
see a certain kind of value system in the culture around us not in the films I think that's really the the issue that
we're dealing with over here in fact um it's this is really important point a lot of people might not know that you
know back in the day when we used to watch these old Hindi films and someone would die would be this soundtrack that would inform you as the audience it's
now to time to feel sad I would go like that right so what n's pointing out is
really important the soundtrack informs you that this is something to celebrate but going back to what he said which is
the director of the film animal had said very clearly that oh you think this is violent after uh Kabir S I will show you
what a violent film really is the next ones would be super violent um so jarita is with us what's argued that was in
response to your review where you said that Kabir Singh was really violent tell us what happened is this is this your
fult did you bring this on girl
look I am not going to give myself credit many please please that
that is a conversation that if someone wants to have in the comment section by all means go ahead and have it I would
not in my wildest dreams have the freaking um you know
lack of self- awareness to be like I I am so influ
influential having said that Anis com anything it could be my
tweet it could be my Instagram post it could be my review on YouTube any conversations that I'm having with journalist like yourself or other women
it is uh you know filmmakers are going on in saying that you should not look at
a piece of art through your own morality don't impose your own morality on someone else's piece of art you always
impose your own morality on piece on Art yeah it could be any format of art it could be a painting a painting will move
you because of what is inside you not just because what is in the uh in the in the on the canvas uh a song will move
you because of what it touches inside you similarly a film will activate your emotion because of what is already
inside you so what um I have spoken about the film is what is already inside me you know violence is one thing but
what who is the violence being committed upon and is the is are those acts of violence being justified as heroic or
are they being show to show a the craft of action choreography is not a problem
action choreography is great it's a very skillful thing for a filmmaker and uh you know St coordinators to achieve on
screen um but it's it's the it's the larger picture of it when you look at it as a painting when you take a take five
steps back and you sit in that Museum and you spend time looking at it what it evokes within you what it evokes within
me is a very feminist response because that's just who I am as a person and that's what who all of us should be but
um you know like nikil was also saying a couple of minutes back it is not
about how dare he make something like that or how dare she say what she said it's about the and Cinema is so complex
it is such a complex art form because it's got visuals it's got audio it's got edit it's got music it's got dance it
got it's got action so all the other art forms are encompassed in a in a in one
single frame and every second is 24 frames we need to have more conversations around what what it means
um you know like more critical conversations around Cinema in general are required in our country I
think taking this back to sanj heg sanj has really been a bit Mr he there's the
legal framework also and there is the moral responsibility because um you know
Bollywood makes what is effectively can we say a mirror to society and so when we're making films
where it shows a young person walking into a school with a gun is there a risk in your mind you
know that we might be encouraging gun violence because we're looking across the world at another country at the US
for example where gun violence in school is a real problem should there be in your opinion a sort of moral
responsibility on film makers to say hey is that something I should be doing should I be encouraging
that well then if they're filmmakers they are not moralists they are not
religious leaders so each one comes with his own set of morals you may make a very
violent film and yet have uh the moral of the film should could very well be
that violence doesn't work uh do they owe a
responsibility well I I think that too is a slippery
slope because okay let me let me push this let me push the legal argument little better I always do when I'm
talking to you the courts have also at the same time argued that Bollywood superstars who endorse products um also
people on the on on Instagram who are influencers who endorse products should be held to some extent uh responsible
for the quality of what they're endorsing they can't just be do it with impunity which is hey you know I'm not
really manufacturing it I'm just endorsing it so they get in and out that's that's you know one argument as well does that level of influence then
translate also to the films that they're making well that is a tricky question
let me let me put it this way when you endorse or influence
somebody body else's product then in a in a sense you are
taking a certain ownership of it but when you are putting your own work
out for the world to judge they you you're essentially saying
judge me this is not a message this is my
particular vision of of the way that I tell this story I have submitted supposing I'm an
author for instance forget films I write a very very violent
book now as long as it does not fall within an incitement to violence or
any of the other prohibited sections I'm still able to uh I'm I I
should be able to publish that book so when some submits his film his book or
maybe even a painting for the Judgment of the public he or
she does not tell the public that uh look you have to follow
it this is a vision that I'm communicating you use your own judgment
on it I think I I think that is where that's where I join issue with suchar on
the Gaye part of it there are people with all kinds of
gazes and when you you are submitting your art and your point of view to the
public say that this is my gaze I know that some of you are going to hate it and that's what the director
said you may you may hate it you may get triggered but this is within the
law this is my point of view you if you if you like it and you
pay and you pay to come into the movie theater and and endorse it so be it if I
if you don't like it but you still come to the movie theater to think about it
so be it my duty is to say that such a vision
is possible and that is the vision that I'm communicating I don't think that there
is a further responsibility
legally for any particular causality so Char you want to respond to
that that everyone has a gaze and everyone's free to put that gaze out as yeah absolutely everybody has a gaze
everybody will put their gaze out because if you're the uh what product you're creating any art form it could be
if it doesn't have your gaze then what is it you're not manufacturing it in a factory every song every poem Every liit
every film it comes from a human person from a human point of view from a from their own lens on Humanity to Gaz
obviously legality is not something that I would debate at all like it's it can't
be illegal to make films again because like tja was saying nikil was saying a few minutes ago uh if you already
there's Al so much legality that gets involved when filmmakers try to express their Creative Vision through their
craft
and uh like Mr HG was also just saying it's like an advertisement isn't it what
are actors doing actors are marketing the film actors actors are agreeing to be a part of the film actors are
agreeing to the message of the film that's why they're participating in the film uh when big movie stars say that I'm not or big Sports people say that
we're not going to endorse sugary soda drinks because they are not good for your body and it's not something that we
actively drink or consume in our real lives we will not endorse it it's similar isn't it actors are also
endorsing uh value proposition of the you know or or the values of the the
film that they are participants in they cannot be separated from the film saying
this this is someone else's Vision not mine I'm just acting can I can I just make one
distinction there yes see when a sports person
uh endorses a fizzy drink or a pan parag or something like
that then that is a product which somebody else has made which has been tested by the market
or you know about the and then you are endorsing it despite everything often
when a film film actor signs a project he starts off with a script he see he
sees a character that he he has has to enact but the ultimate Vision as to how
it comes out the Gaze there is very little kind of control that the actors
themselves have the the responsibility as such the would be more likely to be that
of the producer as well as the Director very often see listen I as a lawyer I
get a brief last minute all that all that look at is what
is the best possible argument that I can make or what is the best possible performance I can give I am not
necessarily endorsing the uh the character of the
client no but Mr I don't want to disagree with you on that point I mean films tend to be now
three four year projects and especially the lead male um you know you know actor
on the film has a tremendous amount of agency on how he's portrayed what he
looks like what he says and what that character builds in if I'm not mistaken so Chara do you want to rebart on on any
of those yeah it's uh again you know uh a film is not a a a new flavor that you
be like I don't know how this flavor tastes films have flavors and those flavors are tried and tested and um you
know since time in Memorial because at the end of the day film are films are human stories and every actor who is
getting a script to say that they don't understand how this script is portraying their character is to infantilize the
actors and take away the responsibility from them so I would disagree with that
politely you would understand see listen you would understand the character but how would the entire story
gel together it's very unlikely I mean amjad Khan as gabber saying let's take
it we would be a different gab Singh from what Danny denzongpa who was
originally slated for that character would would have been he may put in what what he has but
would he endorse would he have had agency over how the ultimate product
came over the chol itself had two separate
endings there was one ending which didn't work and and an ending which got
you but I do I do believe that zanika Bollywood and this zanik Bollywood is
completely different um actors get final sign off if I'm not mistaken on almost
everything especially the male actors but um anyone who wants to you know pops
do you want to take that yes go ahead yeah I mean I mean the comparisons were slightly different between actors uh
working in a film versus uh models or the celebrities who are endorsing
products correct and um I mean one comparison I I totally agree with Sanjay
um is you very well know um and what the product is and if it is legally allowed
to be sold and marketed there is no legal issues you sign correct and then
if you the trouble comes if you don't understand the legalities of it and then
you flaunt and then you put something without a thing saying that you are endorsing without people knowing that
you as a celebrity paid celebrity endorsing that's where you are going to mislead the people and advertising lot
of this influencer advertising will fall into that misleading people as if you
personally are endorsing while you are taking money to say the product is good so therefore you know that's a different
comparison as far as films are concerned you know everyone knows um that where
the film is headed what kind of film will be made you know at least the lead actors you know extras will not know too
much about you know how the film is going to be treated and nobody takes away from the
legality or the right of a director or a writer a story writer or an actor to
express himself freely in in that particular role if it is a guy who is
differently wild and then you are portraying his life and he will do all the Wild Things who because he's
differently where it gets affected is is if the
viewer does not know that he's not a normal human being he differently differently wide he's a psychopath so as
long as people get to know that what the plot is then they will take the right moral out of that that is one part you
know most of the fil at the end of the film you will know that you know is a villain or is a hero or what he is done
is good or bad the second uh part is legally there is absolutely nothing you
cannot ask anybody to stop expressing themselves but there is a something
called morality you know which you put filters you know as creative people we always put that filter because when you
are starting with an idea you know you know how realistically you want to make how authentically you wanted to make how
hyperbolic you know you can make and then can do you want to take it to a sexist level you know by by um taking
the mail protagonist in in a certain way so all the options are available in your
head before writing a script you exercise which one is correct um to your
own conscious you know we in advertising we do what is right for the brand you know here we have to exercise what is
right to my own conscious you know what is the kind of story which I want to tell people and then influence people
with my stories so that is where where the filter need to be applied by
creative people themselves you know nobody can force or enfor enforce them to to to have that filter later or to
crucify them and then that is the only thing you know as a creative person who have
been creative people Pops I want to you know there's there's a clip of an interview that ahed Khan gave many years
ago that is now doing the rounds in which he has effectively said that he believes that using either violence so
sex extensively in a film indicates to a lack of talent and creativity on the
part of director because because these are the two base emotions it's very easy
uh you know to use that but to use like complex emotional ideas uh to build complex characters is far more difficult
and it's when someone lacks creativity that they resort to using violence and sex to sort of promote
their these are all cliches and low hanging fruits which you resort to you
know all the films and all the stories are blazed on either hyperbolic or a conflict now what is the conflict which
is happening how do I resolve it your intelligence lies in picking the resolution you know how are you going to
resolve you know that is where this entire thing whether you
take first I understand Mr he has to leave Mr do you want to just quickly make a closing point before you
go the closing point is that the law recognizes that it has
limitations and if it is within the law you cannot necessarily apply the same
moral standard to everyone people have different morals as long as you do not
seek to forcibly uh impose your morals on on
anybody else or uh you know some
manipulate their morons I think I think people you you should allow people their
full say thank you very much f for having me thank you Mr for I can't yes I
I wish you could stay longer you know I just want to I just want to point out sucha made a really interesting uh sort
of analogy where she talked about U Sports people not endorsing phys drinks right so again there's a very popular
video of the footballer Ronaldo sort of moving all the phizzy drinks away from him in a press conference and finally he
put a you know bottle of water and he said drink water uh the interesting thing about this is there's nothing
illegal with endorsing um fizzy drinks and if someone chooses to do so they're fully within their legal rights to do so
it's the moral stand of whether or not that's a good thing and whether or not that's the message you want to send out
and so everyone associated with a film like this is choosing actively to be
part of that film um nich responding to the Amir Khan statement if this is the the lowest hanging fruit pops also
agreed that people so are we saying then that the 60 CR rup sort of opening is
that the correct number U that this massive opening probably bigger than that probably bigger than that let me
tell you apparently for an a-rated film this was the largest opening ever it was ranir Kapoor's largest Opening Ever 61
CR on the first day second biggest opening of the year after patan um
biggest for the director s ranga biggest non- festive opener so it's done really
well because of this low hanging fruit uh again I mean I don't know if
this is honestly a low hanging fruit because Amir himself did kajani and he obviously made the statement much before
that and and also will Amir make that statement now as the industry stands
today as his relationships and all our relationship with Cinema stands today where he's announced a film with s right
after G to will he make that statement now yeah yeah and and uh absolutely and you know the thing is that if you look
at also I mean I don't want to um again give my judgment on S Wanga R's art but
at least from the films that I've seen whether it is Skil bill or whether it is the raid you know over there the
violence was craft it wasn't and it was Art it was both it and it served a purpose there was story there was an
emotion emotional truth to it and you can't look at that and say that that is low hanging fruit right uh even uh you
know movies about sex uh uh Sex Lies in videotape as an example by sber is is
one of the best you know Independent films that was made in the '90s and all of them all of them have a purpose for
existence and again I think in in in the mind of the director of this film there is a purpose for this film to exist and
within that film and within that Universe are the people violent yes the context of these people are violent yes
and again you know even when you look at individual scenes like someone mentioned that I think so only mentioned that
there was was a I don't know who Ben but there was a gun that was taken in a school um now of course you know there
are films about school shootings there is something called there's a film called uh we must talk about Kevin uh
and there was a film called The Dirties which is about school shootings and which showed again these kids going and
doing this violence but there was a justification and a purpose and the purpose was to horrify you how wrong
this is my problem again with with films like this and you know I saw Kabir Singh ultimately because I need I wanted to be
part of uh at least wanted to have an opinion you know before I give out an opinion and I possibly might watch
animal also for research purposes but uh um even in Kabir Singh right like the first time when when Shahid and his
character Kabir comes into a college and puts his hand on a woman and says you
know she's mine and you know to another guy who wants her you know and there is a very cool banging soundtrack to it and
you know and you know that the point of this is that this is a cool thing to do and the moment you are kind of trying to
make everything look like a cool thing because that is the moral stance that you're taking that's the problem the
fact that there is you know today someone put out a thread that even when films like d had come out at that point
and this is after shuk himself has said that it is you know he was a villain he
did wrong things he got just you know Justified ending he died Sunny Dale was the bigger hero in fact shuk one of his
clip has gone viral saying that you know when I play a bad guy people somehow I make him
likable somehow so I have to be very careful when I do bad guys and which is why when I play bad guys I don't
disrespect women because I don't want men to look at me and feel like this is a likable thing to do but most other
actors don't think like this and don't have these moral standards when it comes to films because they're looking for the
best part that they can get and within that best part if they get to do terrible things you know and that evoke
reactions they will do it so of course zir has agency of course ashika has agency and you know while they might
while the actresses in that film might have lesser agency than a ran they've all chosen but they recognize that this
film is going to make that 61 CR opening because this is what unfortunately the audience wants and the reason they want
it is because they genuinely believe that these kind of alpha men are cool
and that's what we are having a discourse that they are not actually cool this is just a movie fa you're on
mute I have a dog and a child okay I have to mute myself
on so I want to push this conversation a little further away from the director's responsibility to the mirror that
Bollywood shows our society Are We Now a society and I and I want to also I believe that we've gotten
to this point where we are watching a film like animal where someone's making a film like animal because it it's
responding to the environment like you know an animals if evolve based on the
environment that they're in uh the demands of that environment right and I believe that this is the case as well
let's consider the kind of content that gets put up on YouTube the kind of things that gets
said about women the kind of things that get written about women in the comment section U you know the the sort of world
we live in where this the man who sits in his car and gives GES on on video is
an influencer with a huge following the sort of like gym sort of uh testosterone
driven idea of a man the the going back to the traditional idea of a man pushing
past this all this sort of woke feminist nonsense that you expect us to soften up you expect us to do G you
expect rubbish you know men are always meant to be this and you are always meant to be that and you know there's a
there's a massive push back and this push back is not necessarily only male there's push back coming from women as
well is this a reflection of that push back in our
society right now it is you know it is at one point in time to be metosexual
you know to to be nice and then to to to really respond to things in a modern
Progressive Way and then today men are
threatened men are threatened at the very basic level uh correct they are
seeing women are their bosses they are seeing women you know behaving more than
equals and then suddenly you know if you see not just this film you know last
five years you know you see the list of films which have made it big from South North you know wherever it is Leo pushpa
Vikram kdf rrr Jaya Javan Rana gadar to
and bhagan Singh bhagan Singh kri you know you you you look at all these films
what are the the reflection of the society you know I mean either you can
mirror the society or you can influence the society the choice is yours and then
today's film makers and storytellers are choosing the path of I mirror the
society and mirror is realistic is authentic based on facts because you are
only showing the mirror but you know in this case you know they are not showing mirroring the society they are actually
creating a hyper story you know of one little aspect of something and then
making a story out of it I mean while we can argue and then say that creative people must have the freedom to express
the way they wanted to express tell the stories and most of the stories are relevant to that you know era and then
may not be relevant retrospective to a generation correct it may not be but
having said all that you know somewhere um for the sake of wanting to be
different you know wanting to be original if people start to think about you know how long this me too will
continue of this action and then cruelity crudity you know raw metosexual
I mean raw alpha male behavior in the society and then killing people you know
you a hero fights uh because somebody kills his father he will go and then
kill 5,000 people in the movie if you keep a head count of that correct so
that fine so it's fine to take revenge of one
killing to 5,000 people you know killing in that so all these are hyperbolic things you know which are not really
mirroring the society if you were to mirror revenge and then you go to some extent to to really make that happen and
then you struggle and then do that you know if you have seen Mom you know it has a beautiful story line and it does
you know it's a fiction but it does create that tension in the story telling and also the characters but you know
this has gone little overbo is my opinion while I'm no judge of anybody
somebody else's work if I don't like I don't see but um by and large people who
create content must you know keep a filter uh of their own uh Consciousness
in what they creating you know I just want to bring up in this conversation Andrew Tate right there was research
done about the fact that and for for those of our audience who don't know Andrew Tate is a a sort of um online
content creator who puts out really misogynistic sort of alpha Mele ideas
and is watched by very very young boys and there was research that Kim said that the young boys who happen to follow
him and watch him on the internet also share his misogynistic ideas and in there their sort of treatment of the of
the girls their age is very different and is informed by those videos that they watch and I just want to spend a
minute talking about it and for people in the comment section we'll read out some of the comments sanj he was here we've all you know agreed and
established that freedom of speech is Paramount and nothing really legally is wrong with the film animal we're
discussing its impact on society or we discussing society's impact that has led to a film like animal so Char the
andrate question of that kind of content going up on a regular
basis give me the long answer that's kind of content going up on a regular basis of the internet leading also you
know like pops pointed out the film like rrr which glorified a fictional Freedom
um fighting movement which was fully violent and our freedom uh movement was nonviolent in characteristic but we sort
of you know imagining a different India right now what's your response to
that um look at where rrr went look at how much it traveled look at what it did
for uh not just SS rajali but the actor um the music it one an Oscar comparison
to that if I because I was very heavily um trolled for that review as well
whatever you know you're used to that kind of stuff you're a woman's speaking opinion on the internet hello good
morning um but you know compared to what that film uh the impact of that film and the number of people it reaches and the
number of mes it reaches compared to a channel that is just about hit 100,000 subscribers you it it's not comparable
uh you know so putting everything together you it it's not all cont content it is somebody's making a film
somebody's making a YouTube video somebody's making regular Instagram reals everything has its own life everything has its own reach everything
goes to different different places but that doesn't mean that's Al you know a feedback that people keep giving in my
comment section is if you don't like it don't watch it why why did you go to watch the film if you're not going to like it no if somebody is treating you
badly you're going to say something you're not going to look the other way it's not personally treating me badly
but you know what I'm saying if if if something bothers you you you say something you put you put use your um uh
right of you know whatever freedom of speech in in in in that scenario um
and you
knowbody saying don't make faces how disrespectful imagine live or the the
impunity with which men on the internet operate don't make faces somebody who telling I'm sitting on a freaking news
panel with freaking fade suan somebody's telling me don't make faces live to my face so you know you know Andro knows
who he's making these videos for sandep knows who his film is for in they are
not like silly gullible innocent none of us are silly gullible and innocent we
know what the films are for we know what they are saying and then that's why what we have to say is also has to be that
much calculated say you and I are running our you know things on YouTube on our
own channel we have platformed ourselves who's platforming us our voice our descent our push back to the end rotates
of the world no one we're doing it on our own it's the absolute least as cultural commentators as women who feel
like we have a voice and the vocabulary and the words in whatever language we choose to put that opinion out yeah I
cannot rest if I don't do
it I can't look the other way nonsense while Andrew Tate you know for better of
of us has the ability and the legal right to put out his opinion so does sar
it's and and you know in that in the universe where they both exist but nikil and and you know an understanding of
what messaging is going on from a film like animal and we talked about this I remember when Vikram Singh came out uh
kab sing I'm sorry came out as to what message that sends out this sends out a far clearer message to young boys who
are in high school right now who are going to be like fil you know this is what you what you what in your mind is
that message that's gone out right now and how much pressure are these boys is going to be under to sort of portray
that same you know that same sort of masculine energy yeah I think uh um I
think when we spoke about low hanging fruits right I think we were talking about violence and sex and I think uh
provoking the society into a certain kind of
um Alpha Behavior a certain kind of chest tping uh you know angry bully
behavior is the easiest thing to do actually you know it's far more
difficult and that's where you know uh films like those are tougher to make and
they get made very less because it's very it's far more difficult to evoke uh empathy it is far more difficult to
evoke tears or Humanity from Cinema but it is far easier to evoke provocation or
or anger or irritability or misogyny because those are emotions which are
which actually don't those are base emotions they don't really take as much effort and and the unfortunate thing is
that uh uh because most filmmakers want to obviously also make money because
this is a business you know we keep it art But ultimately there is Commerce involved and most producers and
directors are always looking at the easy way out to make that kind of money versus taking the tougher route and
saying something that is the truth and again I'm not saying that this is not s vangar R's truth in fact it very much
must very much must be and that is also a very a tricky thing to talk about but
uh uh but yeah I don't I think it's a very um if you don't take responsibility as filmmakers at as artists for the art
that we putting out into the world then you know what are we doing with our lives I feel you know honestly like I
feel like um if you have not studied science and not studied Commerce and
fought with your parents to get into the film industry to get into the media industry to call yourself an artist to
write an original story to put your truth out into the world if you're doing all of that ultimately to provoke
someone and show a middle finger to someone and say oh you you got triggered because I showed one woman slapping here I'll show another woman licking
somebody's boot now you tell me what what are you going to say to me I mean when you're doing it for those reasons you know that's the problem I feel uh
you know with films like this and again I'm not at all saying that you know s Angar should not be allowed to make the
film that he wants to make make it but I'm saying that you know it's very easy for filmmakers like that to point out
fingers at everybody else and say oh you got offended but then when we as a response talk about the fact that the
reason this is wrong or the reason it is distasteful according to us is this and
not in the context of the character but in the context of what it is representing to this Society at large then they also get offended right like
then who is getting triggered you're also getting triggered you know and but but when you get offended then your army
of uh you know supporters then you know latch on to us get angry at us you know
call us names uh especially women you know and that's the unfortunate truth to truth to it right most women who are
reviewing this film are being called you look at I mean sucha who has always taken feminist ansers I'm saying even a
senior you know uh journalist today and I've just been seeing their com sections it's all just crash stuff and you know
when you make films like that you kind of almost give a um you know free pass to people to be like well this guy acted
like an animal so it is probably okay for you to as well but it's not and those are the things that if at any
point of time as an example and I just finish this one point Fe if at any point of time uh sandep ranir or anybody
associated with the film would go out and actually say folks this is just a film this is being made only for
entertainment uh this is about an animal this is about a character who behaves like an animal this is not real life
don't take it seriously don't we not endorsing the thing that happens in this
film we have just made it for entertainment even if they say base level things like that I think at least
there should be some sincerity to what they're trying to create but over here that's not the case it's almost in fact
the opposite where it is being said that so what like this exist and you know but rebuttal to that last Point nikil actors
and filmmakers and writers should not have to go out and justify their films once the films are out what they are
saying you shouldn't expect we can't expect this from anyone to be like no no no I let me justify my movie this is my
movie you make of it what you will you already Justified your film the fact that it's out there it's been made for
years in yours it's Justified and I mean it purely on the sense of your uh
accountability and and what you are what is the lens like you said if your lens
actually and your intent actually is not to create something that is is just provocating for the sake of it and that
is just misogynistic for the sake of it you will at least say that out that we have created a bad character like
everyone someone some people are putting threats about Scar and Taxi Driver you know scari for you know has created
killers of the flower wound he's the one who actually stands up and says here's what's wrong with Society he's been
doing that repeatedly over the years he speaks about it all his interviews he speaks about taking accountability for
us creating a you know a society where terrible things happen where terrible exist and and then also explains why
they deserve the end that they deserve because the comments that we get on our reviews especially female film critics
are uh the idea is to shove us off the internet to uh get us to shut up to not
have these ideas to not express these opinions who is responsible for that who is responsible for hundreds and
thousands of people working together to silence uh dissenting opinion that is
the responsibility a film must take absolutely AB bring in a different angle right and and Pops I know you have
something to say and you can respond to this yeah at the end of the day yes if you
give things to young people they will take it correct they are at a rebellious
place and then you know they want you know all the males in the country of that age wanted to be like that it is
like asking children um that do you want chocolates and then you give them free
chocolates as much as you want and then they will lap it up they'll eat eat they will not be they will not know the
repercussion of eating so many chocolates somewhere the mother guides them Society is also like that correct
and then the people who are influences need to have you of course you give violent films you give sexist film you
put you know 12 rapes in a film and then people will go and then watch it it will become Blockbuster correct it will
become a blockbuster it will not 300 CES 700 CES it will correct but what attick
are we are really um uh judging those
you know films so it is not the money which they make it is not the the impact
which you are making and what kind of impact are you making and then you as an individual as an influencer as a writer
and as whatever you are as an individual what impact are you making on people is
it the impact which you want or you want you know some other impact you can you know you can uh you can exaggerate
things to make a point but you can't um shy away from that exaggeration and then
you know and then finally what is the moral which people get it's okay to go
and then kill people it's okay to fight another thing before this panel
right recently there was a film called thank you for coming that was made Bui R kapor it was about a young woman
not having achieved an orgasm and then trying many ways and many partners in order to do so now when the film came
out and this is besides the point of whether it was a good film or a bad film when the film did come out there were
many reviewers on YouTube who were basically saying how can you teach young
girls in the country that they should be going out and having uh you know multiple partners and they should be looking for orgasms and they should be
you know because you're influencing young people and this is the message you're sending out that this kind of you
know um this this is the kind of behavior that young women should indulge in how is
that different from the argument youall are making right
now very good I think we should leave it to
individuals and their Consciousness you know nothing you can do about it the kind of film I want to make I'll make
the kind of film you want to watch you go and then watch nobody else can judge and nobody can actually add uh
intelligence lies in people who are at the power to use the power misuse the power and then guide the power in a
different direction at the end of the day what do you want to be known for corre I think it also you know there
is something you know which your conscious tell you that is it worth living the life which you have or you
are not that is what determines your own morality correct so I just want to I
want to stop here because there's someone called viewers choice in our comment section who wants to know why you and I are not
in the kitchen actually because intermittent fasting I'm going
to the kitchen I'm going to make myself some breakfast so am I I have a different response for viewer's choice
and it is this because my place is not in the kitchen and our place has not
been in the kitchen for many many years and it is unlikely that we're going to go back to the
kitchen because we are here and we have opinions and just like sandep w who can
make a film like animal I have an I have the ability to make this show sucharita
has the ability to have an opinion on this show and we can put it out on YouTube if you don't like it don't
watch all right so if you don't like our opinion go away it's not don't you to
watch this I Will Survive my channel will survive quite well without I am just I am just from this whole
conversation taking this one thing away Mr Shar just called film critics mothers telling children don't eat chocolate I
am mother I will take it I will be your mother I think I think you know to to
add to um I mean f the question that you asked about thank you for coming I think uh eventually this discourse is
important but we must be allowed to have this discour the the issue with films like this is that they want to uh you
know put a thunderous stop to any discourse that tries to raise a finger against those things you know which is
the problem in itself right have that discourse let us allow all the opinions around this to exist
and engage with those opinions as an artist don't engage with it uh from the
lens of a troll you know if there is something that you find problematic either talk about it and listen about it
and try to come to a place where both of you everybody can actually get to a a common place where you can understand
why this was done but we don't allow for that now if you talk about thank you for coming as a film of course because women
having agency in our country has not happened for a very very in in the world hasn't happened for such a long time
that films that talk about women's agencies are far fewer and far more uh
almost seen as inventive or Innovative you know
versus correct and you know and and films about men with guns have been as
age old as Cinema themselves right so now what is the evolution of those films what that you doing different in a film
about violence that has not been done thousand times before and how are you showcasing a certain kind of
understanding of the world around you when you showcase this violence on screen you know I mean I am not going to
again judge or ask the producer director of a film like that to do what they want to do but as a filmmaker if I'm going to
write something I'm going to ensure that there is a a positive version of a world I want to showcase because there is
enough toxic representations that have already uh uh you know that already out there and as Mr sha said unfortunately
most people are not critically sitting back and looking at the nuances of why this was made of why this was not fair
or whether or not this is an animalistic portrayal or whether whether it is cool if you're going to put a banging
soundtrack when somebody is being murdered they will think that is cool you know in our and you know I mean the irony that I always see when I go to
theaters when there's a smoking scene you know you will have like smoking is injurious to health but when
some you won't have like killing people is injurious to health or you know don't do it that's not something that you know
we we don't endorse as a society that's okay Bloodshed is okay sex is censored
uh but Bloodshed and and murders and misogyny is absolutely okay there is never going to be disclaimer around that
and I feel like we are those disclaimers then and allow us to be those disclaimers you choose to watch whatever film you want but recognize that this
film is not should not be an endorsement of society because if you yeah last
point I say think this is then you should also look at Javan and and patan and also talk how much how feminist
those films are in in which where Shah ruk Khan in both those films almost is
led by you know actresses over there in the first scene in patan where D is introduced shuk is being saved by the
woman and he's completely cool with it he he he's like yeah she's great at what she does why who am I to bother her and
he just allows himself to be saved because he knows that she's great at her job even though you know it doesn't matter what gender shees in the same way
as in in Javan his army is of women and if you're not looking and taking things and if you're not looking at that and
saying that is the society I want to create then don't look at animal and say this is the society I want to create
this is what an alpha is like both films have made Blockbuster openings in fact talking about two films that came out on
the same day on um One S there was um this film there was animal on the same
day Sam bahadur came out which is about a real life sort of hero or
one could argue the real life alpha male you know who sort of talked back to his prime minister an idea that would be
difficult to digest in this moment but you know she was a woman um and that
film netted grossed I think in the first day six CR and this film did 60 and so it's
very clear you know which sort of alpha male uh you know our society is leaning towards right now I'm going to give the
last word to suchar because the the woman should always have the last word
girl Netflix film releas right where Gary Oldman plays Herman movitz the
person who wrote uh citizen King it's a historical about how that film came about and you know why the film is as
important as it is now movie scene where I think he's talking to the editor of the film or the producer of the film and
the person says to M that responsility says in
return I'm paraphrasing
obviously a size of the people on front of the screen responsibity
vulnerable what we are saying what we are doing goes straight to that person and that's what we are responsible
toward people sitting in that dark room it's uh you put your own morality on
reviewing a film you put your own morality while you're watching the film you also put your own morality while you're making the film while you're writing the film we are a free country
we will as much as people are free to make the films that they want to make we are also free to push back as much as we
want to push back and we one must one must always always yeah if if art is not calling
truth to power what is the Point yeah yeah I want to leave it there but you know in closing just to just to wrap
this up for our audience the conversation we first established the fact and I agree with it that um the
director of the film animal is fully within his rights to make whatever film he chooses our laws allow him to do so
uh there is a process in place which involves a sensor board the sensor board is done his job in this case and given it an a rating and said children should
not watch this film it's too violent so that process is also work now within that category it has done really well uh
but there's nothing legally wrong with the film that is made do films influence
young people older people yes they do we tend to especially in India make Heroes
out of um our film actors we tend to sort of copy their hairstyles we tend to copy their dialogues u a lot of people
model their behavior on what they see in those films and so there is a responsibility that comes with being
that popular but it's not a legally enforced responsibility but that film exists in my opinion within a larger
society that also involves schools it also involves teachers it involves parents it involves um you know larger
society different other kinds of content that's available on the Internet or on television and in newspapers and in
books that should collectively also inform this individual along with what they're
seeing on the big screen so while the makers of the film animal are fully
within their right to put out a film that is arguably violent misogynistic
and does so on purpose and also glorifies that violence and misogyny all of the rest of us are also within our
rights to put out statements reviews opinions on that film of what we liked and we didn't like to tell other people
not to see it if we choose to do so to protest in front of the film theater peacefully and say don't watch this film
we think it's too violent everybody is within their rights to do so as long as the violence doesn't become a reality in
the protest or in real life I'm going to leave it there thank you so much for watching enjoy your freedom of speech
enjoy it responsibly


at least I'll root for him I'll go and Shake do you also find a bit interesting that a few of these um people who who
who tend to have certain opinions they they also struggling actors or maybe directors or maybe they're related to
filmmakers an chra was messaging me constantly that she wants an interview
and she messaged me that doas and after the release like you see
a different color Raj called me after after he criticized my film after I said
that whatever I said in ano's interview he called me and said like Mr W I would
like you to join the round table I said like dude you know you never liked my
filming you hated my film and you hated my guts an Kapoor sir told me that um he thinks ranir Kapoor is tall Raj Kapoor
the way you want me to look in the note scene I think we need 15 days more if you have to Define ranir kapur's
performance in a word or sentence it's not one word there's so many adjectives yeah how much credit will you give to
the screenplay of animal I can't uh dissect and give a percentage but it played a major role best compliment that
you've received for animal so far uh a says
and uh your favorite song of animal there a lot I mean like I equally like all the rashika yti DI the biggest
national crush of India right now rashika is a national crush of India and uh for sure and now I think Kabir saying
your animal film closer to your heart uh
Arjun Mas
Mas Shah Khan in Jaan Shah Khan in patan H
your alltime favorite [Music]
actor hi this is s r Wanga you're watching connect FM Canada with
faridun animal has had an extraordinary response but more importantly um it's a
film made by a courageous director um a director who believes in himself and as
Mr ramar told me recently that uh he is a director who is not afraid to be judged and um it it rarely happens that
a director becomes a superstar and he is being mobbed wherever he goes and it's a huge privilege to have uh um s angari
with us um right now on connect FM Canada uh sandip thank you very much for your time and pleasure having you with
us thank you thank you for having me here thank you for thank you if you can start with what what Mr ropal Varma told
me that here is a filmmaker who's not afraid to be judged yeah do you think that it's one of the finest compliments that you've received yes yes yes yes of
course because uh he always uh uh came to rescue me like a big brother without
even calling him or without even asking for it you know during agility and now during animal so yeah I want to meet him
soon I was traveling a lot so I called him and I said sir I want to meet you and talk to you not on the phone so I'm
going to meet him soon right um massive success for the
film I think almost all of us we knew that it'll be a huge success but um people have seen it like 11 times 12
times and they're going back again um do you do you think that maybe the success of the film um has exceeded your
expectations to be frank uh I didn't aim at the box office while we doing it
because I always felt a story like this to be told and uh just to see the excitement in the audience when this
kind of a story comes into the theater but uh in the throughout the process of the film I guessed this kind of a number
I because uh you even when I was starting to run be and my producers so
but uh it went a little Beyond than my expectations but I I guess somewhere around 6 to 700 but now it is 900 plus
so yeah yeah quite uh excited to see where
it's going to you know end I mean the final number see number is again the
audience you know in the footfalls not money I mean the excitement of seeing the number is seeing the number of
people coming to the theater and watching the film yeah okay how much credit would you give to the screenplay
of the film um the main villain of the film you're not introducing him anywhere till the end you're keeping him for the
last 15 minutes maybe which is something that has baffled many people as well yeah um how how crucial is the
screenplay of this film because I feel it's very very crucial and very important because uh if I wouldn't have
opened the G killing episode like that the way it is now uh it would have been a boring episode because if it is in if
this story is told in a leaner fashion I don't know how much attention I would have you know HED for the entire film
throughout the runtime I feel it it is the it is the backbone the story this
this uh the scenes treatment and the screenplay I think screenplay played a major role and coming to Willen part
Boba because everybody knew now looking at the teaser and the trailer that Bobby
the is a villain and I knew that they going to wait and from the beginning of right after 15
minutes of the film you know there's a tension of the villain in throughout the film but we don't see his face so even
after the interval I could have opened him right after the interval but I thought it is a very routine way to open the villain in
the film so I made the audience wait for almost 28 30 minutes and then I just
introduce like a you know like you know like a face off like a bright we call it you know so so I I always wanted to show
that you know be is in a very uh you know in a very down phase and whereas
will is having fun and getting ready for the third marriage so I wanted to show
the difference and uh yeah it worked the waiting worked actually you see uh
villain after 2 and a half hours of the film and yeah yeah because uh I I always
felt you know because right from the beginning I have this thing in the mind that hero
or you know on the runway so when I imagine that uh image I wanted somebody
Macho who's who's broader than ranir who looks powerful than ran then I thought
like I know nobody else and Bob Ser so yeah right there many many I think
extraordinary sequences if youve talking about the screenplay part of it at the end he's hugging anel Kapoor sir and the
next shot is that he's in the arms of shaki kapor Sab and and uh crying
inconsolably um how do you conceptualize such such such scenes they they've had a
certain impact on people yeah yeah because I wanted to show that you know we have shown throughout the film we
have seen hero reacting to everything which comes in his way and we have shown him like a you know his we have shown we
have picturized him in a very powerful way and he's very strong and taking decs
and you know uh so I thought like in the climax
uh because see the whole point of him doing all this is to secure his father's life and when he comes to know that he's
going to die I think I I
thought like like helpless boy little boy so I thought like that will create a
lot of you know empathy and uh drama for the audience I I I thought audience will
feel bad for him for whatever mistakes whatever things he has done I feel they
have this you know empathy towards it was
and he's holding Mr uncle and crying he's not even holding his wife or his cousins and the way he's holding and
crying and says like Mr Uncle so that that that that made me feel sad when I
was writing also and equally more sad when I was when we were shooting almost
everybody had tears in their eyes while the scene was happening so yeah there there's so many sequences which have
become so huge um many films have been made as far as a father son relationship
is concerned uh Andel sir told me that I think he had requested you to maybe watch M aam and and films like shaki for
example which have had a very strong fatherson um relationships um like a like a sequence
that the way it has become it is it is extraordinary it is
something that that that that that has baffled I think so many people how do you how do you get these these these
ideas in the first place to and maybe to have the vision that it can have the sort of impact that it'll finally have
see the thing is it's a very simple scene actually it's a simple scene of exchanging the roles but you know in the
teaser in the trailer you have seen couple of times father slapping the S and in the narrative also you see ran
saying you know that that is a kind of planting which happened when he when he
retaliates when he uh you know shouts at the father
so and even the even the voice even the the treatment of the scene is like he's
walking and an is just looking at him helpless you know that all adds up to the effect of uh you know when you're
watching as an audience so I feel it's a simple scene but the placement of it you
know it worked a lot and the performances are topnotch you know and
uh yeah and uh and then in the teaser also because in the trailer in the teaser you have seen he's getting
slapped and in the trailer you see son giving uh you know that kind of arrogant
reply and so I thought that that that will work and it worked the way I imagined even in the
trailer and uh because uh because that's the only situation where he can say what
he has to say because he knew he's saying don't worry you know the science
has improved a lot I know so many doctors in us but because it's Advanced stage he knew
that he's going to die so he's just telling to himself that nothing will happen but uh I think subconsciously he
knew that I think that's the reason he thought this is the situation this is the only chance I have now in my life
I'll at least tell him what has what have undergone only about one
day so I thought but rather than uh you know
uh just making a sad scene I thought like see the The Angst is coming because
of love you know because of uh so I thought like it should it should give the audience that uh it's a NeverEnding
angst you know it's not going to settle also so it all helped for me so I was I
I wanted to reach a point in the climax for that I was trying to play around with all these scenes and dialogues and
all that and which eventually everything fell in place yeah you know what what
what fascinates me about you as a filmmaker is that you you're someone who who loves to surprise um usually
concept it's a dangerous situation so usually expected and it's a nice thing
to say
and um it's it's not a s s wer film it is the S Wenger film so you you like to
surprise how how important is it for you to uh not deliver something that that people are expecting and to to be
unpredictable see first thing is the character is like that very unpredictable and top of
it and while telling the story see that you can be unpredictable in the
story see only few times you get a chance and there I I think like we should make full
use of it and knowing her because the
kind of intrinsic details what they share in the relationship only ran Singh will knew about Gali whether she can
really cope up with the relationship with another man maybe he's saying that in in that context or maybe he doesn't
want to see his kids uh seeing their mother with another
the man you know things can be it you know the Reas can be too many but I thought like it's a it's it's a great
romantic line to say like you know suffer in pain but don't get married so yeah so there
are there are many dialogues which are in English um as I told you happiness is
a decision is is is one of the I think coolest lines that I have heard in in in a really long time and there are many
many such lines how how important is it for you to to use the language that you feel
um you want to use instead of worrying about the fact that maybe English
simplify um how important is it for you to follow your own heart when it when it comes to making films because I always
even during Arjun and Kabir and even in animal when when the dialogue is written I always try to say it while typing I
always try to say it now Sor has written the dialogue when we sitting together I always say that dialogue out because I I
I just check whether how how the flow is I I I make sure it is very colloquial
and I feel if I if you have to say it in telu or Hindi happiness is a decision I
think it looks I don't know how it sounds also because it might
sound but you will feel language sing it has to sound very Cal and real
and natural so and English has become part of our life now uh
so happening you
know understood the
context but most of them understood happiness decision simple
words you know it's it's even people who don't who can't
write in English also they understand those lines and it's shorter
also happiness is a decision I me say it or
how you say it in Hindi happiness is a
decision you went into 80s I've never seen never heard maybe
fesa f is a Udu word right yeah it goes into a different Zone till then how he's
talking to the sister SE when you compare like that so I always see like
same thing with the music also when same thing with the dialog Al nothing should pop out so I thought you know that's only
you know Deion making Point yeah so you had you only announced it before
itself that M um I'm not uh going to get toned down because of any sort of
criticism and my next film is going to be more violent and I'll show what what a violent film is all about uh but were
you were were you in a way a bit surprised with the with the sort of criticism that has come from certain quarters I expected this I expected this
criticism it is going to be like multiplied 10 times than because Kabir
Singh criticism was a surprise remember we spoke about this four years back because arj it was like one 12% and
Kabir it was more Kabir was a surprise for me and I understood the way the critics and uh people who were critic
you know criticizing the film uh I understood their point of view and uh it
was I never understood understood I know from where the energy is coming from they only see particular few points
about uh you know in in a film they can't uh criticize or review a film in
totality and uh sorry to say but they don't have any knowledge of the context
why it has been said they don't understand the backstory they only pick few points that has happened in Kabir I
saw that and I very well knew that it will be multiplied like five 10 times and it has happened and still I'm not
bothered because uh it's because they are not doing it in the right fade for
example uh Mr badan also you know reviewed and you
know critique the film he said few points I thought okay you know I didn't feel bad because he was talking about so
many aspects in the film making as I told you last time four years back they only pick on few points even the the
last time when I said in an's interview I was really pissed I was really angry that time you know and uh even it was
not a deliberate uh thing that I wanted to tell because I was almost we're finishing the interview and she said I
hope you know next film will not uh will generate less criticism then I had to say that no no it'll be more because if
you say a love stories a viant film then uh I knew that I'm going to make a violent film and so I said you'll see
what a violent film will be and uh so when you challenge and when you live up to the expectations they'll hate you
more that's what is happening now so yeah right so I was I was watching a
discussion and Mr Sanjay heg he he a lawyer an advocate senior senior
Advocate um so he was basically responding to to a comment about uh gaze
um in um in animal and the morality aspect uh so he said that gays and and
morality basically these are uh they they have no no business as far as uh
what what a filmmaker wants to express himself there's no legal standing first of all in that and it's something which
is very very relative as far as gays and and morality is concerned um do you do you find at times that maybe when when
when a certain people they run out of arguments um they say certain things just to just to be relevant in a
way yeah you see uh because because what what is more fascinating and amusing for
me now is I expected exactly how much they
going to talk about this film and the result is exactly the way I thought way I imagine so in a way I
understood uh uh you know their mental status and their IQ so
yeah and morality and gay is
like no you can't go ahead also in story what
what if the morality comes into picture then you can't make this film
simple
Buton show so and it is clearly said it's a
irated fil film it's over and about 18 years so and people are saying
like girls are feeling insecure high school girls that high school girls are not supposed to go and watch this film
even the boys so uh right in fact ramu s
said one thing that um if um if if if that would have been the case then after
hamon um there should have been more emphasis on on joint families which has not really been the case yeah when we
like that saying you know nobody became gangsters after you know making seeing Shiva or Satya they take it in a very
funny way uh I don't know why only the responsibility Factor comes only
watching the film there's so many things which are in real happening in the society for that
nobody reacts only only for the film they react which is very funny I never understood
this phenomena and what I figured out is like
but he wants to voice out for
example at least I'll root for him I'll go and
sh so you're making money Fame name
criticizing my films then go ahead that's what happened with most of the
critics during Kabir Singh they shot to F by criticizing Kabir sing so now they
are enjoying the yeah do you also find a bit interesting that a few of these um
people who who who tend to have certain opinions they they're also struggling actors or maybe directors or maybe
they're related to filmmakers um do you find that maybe it is a bit unethical for for people um if they are
also pursuing certain the the same field yeah um to just um literally try and
harm the film yeah that's what I mean like how should I how should I put it like you know I don't want to say but since you asked an CH was messaging me
constantly that she wants an interview like I can I have six seven
messages continuously we should meet we should meet we should meet and she messaged
me and after the release like you see a different color so I said like okay I mean what to
do because what I see is like there's a clear hatred towards the filmmaker than
the film which is what actually surprising me and when last time when I
went and sat with her I was uh you know
interview talking about her husband's film that's not the fact because I I am
a fan of VI Chopra because when you see K Arjun RI I use that song you know
that's a song from parinda so you know and uh I didn't say about Sanju
because you know her husband is a producer of the film so but
uh yeah right um but uh when you read a few of the views and and you see certain
videos does it does it upset you see I see Frankly Speaking I if it
is genuinely that's what I'm seeing if it genuinely comes like you feel like you don't need this so much of oil and
somebody says you don't need to shoot 300 people you could have you could have done it in 100 people also then I might
understand maybe sh maybe but when you when you when you
attack the intention of the filmmaker only then it becomes bizarre is because
what what is because what I feel
is Left Right Center you criticize a film in the worst way and after 3 4 days
or maybe a week you call the filmmaker and call him for the round
table I said like why you want me to sit at your show you never believed in my
fil and my vision see for examp example uh for example uh rajim Mas called me
after after he criticized my film after I said that whatever I said in ano's
interview he called me and said like Mr W I would like you to join the round table I said like dude you never you
never liked my film you hated my film and you hated my guts you criticized it so badly and if I come and say what are
you going to talk I said like you know your relationship ship like people who
criticize my films at this level for them the relationship between me and you
is from the screen to the seat you go and watch my next film and do another
video and I'll react another video but I'm not going to commence it in your show
so how this things how they at what level they operate yeah so but I figured
out that he gave up uh you know reviewing and critizing films now so
yeah right so uh s there a senior trade analyst um mentioned in his reviews that
at least 100 crores will be added to the film's collections because of uh the way the film is being
criticized um I also uh heard a few statements in the sense that that sandep
sandep knows that what is it that is going to um um just get the audience
into into into theaters and maybe because of that he's he's putting these scenes um I've I've known you for quite
some some time and U I personally have have I I find you to be extremely I think simple person um and I don't think
you you're that calculative maybe to to just uh put certain scenes so that that that can possibly be bringing to the
theaters you're in a way U just going away from the from the family audience you're you're using English at at many
times maybe I don't think that um getting the audience at any cost is something that that you're you're really
looking at do you find it a bit disrespectful when when a filmmaker's intentions are doubted the number is
multiplied
now I don't think so I ever do that ever in my life in future maybe you know they
felt you know that the last guest what the old rir Kapur does they thought it
was giving it back to the critics because an chobra herself felt that you know was doing to the critics but my
intention was not that you know I thought like I'll just end the film with attitude because I want audience to
think and root for part two I mean animal park so that's the intention but
they took it in another way because the moment he does the guess the next the next shot is my name comes on screen so
they thought I was just giving back to them I don't do that yeah right okay now the interesting part
is that um someone in Dallas a girl in Dallas she told me that if you uh if you
interview sandep so please just tell him um that why is it that people are not talking about uh the sequence of K when
rashmika gives it back to to ranir and he just listens um and it's a very strong I think rashmika has been
presented very very strongly as well um so do you as as you as you mentioned in the in the beginning as well that
selectively certain things are picked up yeah and certain things they're not not said and maybe I think the film should
be looked in entirety in in a proper context yeah because it is out of their capacity trust me I'm telling you
because I've seen reviewing other films also the way they talk I feel like all these guys they should go to China to
you know in China you know what's the most happening thing in China the English tution they're good with English
so they should go and tutor in English because other than that every time you see their reviews you find new English
words other than you don't find anything else because even Kabir also they did that they were very selective in Kabir
slapped they never spoke about PR slap back pry was the first person to slap and never never they never said about
that I don't know how that you know even to even today in an animal they say uh
the hero of the film made the girl to lick his
shoe and it's a torure for three and a half hours if you want to go go watch
but I would suggest you not to go how can you say that such a shame seriously such a shameful thing to say that you
know how can you do that why you are saying to the audience because nobody cares that but still there will be few
people that think like okay let's not watch this film and this negative thing
is not going to help it is going to hamper the film for
sure negative you think because
ofaj and that fgy girl opening it's because the craft
nobody speaks about the craft nobody speaks about editing sound design nothing because they're they're literally illiterate and uneducated when
it comes to films they are like they have no sense of you know to criticize a film or a review a film they only see
the sensitive part of it and they speak and then down D and like this is what to say like you know then and if
at all you want to sit with them and talk face to face also they don't have the guts to do that they beat her on the
bush and talk some nonsense and the show is over so yeah so I think I've drifted from
your question was I answering the right answer to your your question I think no it's fine it's fine
it's absolutely fine you know what what what is interesting that um there are there are there are some people who are
talking about the film and they've not seen the film exactly exactly last time I'll tell you one thing you find it
irresponsible if you've not seen the fil very responsible during Kabir Singh I'll tell you after after you interviewed me
that that next day because that time the this fully uh Bombay was packed with water I mean there's fully rains if you
remember I was supposed to go back to Hyderabad because this the the flight were not functioning so I was stuck in
Bombay then I got a call from NDTV saying that you need to come and sit in the panel so I said like okay
I'll come so I sat in the car I was going they're calling me are you coming are you late then I said yeah I'm coming and then I asked who are who are the
people who are there so that I know then they mentioned a few names and I asked
them
as but at least know what the
f but they're sitting and talking a lot they spoke for one one and half far in
the prime time and entertaining and they were showing my pictures in the background you know
crime a director speaks like that see the audacity of the director and all the nonsense it was and what what I said in
an show is I said it's like it's a context I'm saying like if you know if
you don't have the sincerity in expressing yourself that's the whole point and I said it's applies with both
but the only point but second time when I said I didn't say V versa so they used it very
selectively and I quoted it like as though you know I said something very uh you know it's so stupid I'm I'm not
uh feeling bad but I'm feeling like how how can they do this like like what what
is this I never understood and uh they have I mean what now one thing I understood now 5 years
almost 5 years in Bombay there's a gang there's a gang they only like one
particular kind of films they praise that particular filmmaker film and other filmmakers films are done to death I
mean and uh during Arjun radi also you know there is a culture of giving money to the critics and reviewers or whatever
you know I never did that I never did that I never do that yeah I never you if
you notice in my entire life in my three films I never tweeted or you know pasted
the review on my Facebook wall or insta or Twitter I never do that the first
time I did was rgbs because I respect that man and I'm a big fan of his work and I truly believe how much he has
contributed for Indian Cinema nobody has done that
and but I never do that so maybe you know I I'm not in the good
books of them that's why they talk nonsense but they don't they don't even try to
analyze the film they only talk about two three things man such a illiterate people these people are
so what I figured out is after animal now I I know that this is going to be there till how many other films I make
they going to be
there which I mean I don't even they dare to criticize animal park
so I'm not saying that now I'll do it more because the content is like that yeah okay and and something about your
association with with buhan G um you guys are doing more films together um um
how important is to have a courageous producer backing you up because more than courageous producer obviously is a
gutsy producer but majorly uh my my brother is also part of the you know
this thing so I don't have any interference and I don't have come
somebody coming and telling me why you going there how many days are going to shoot or or what is this music or why
you are taking that particular actor nothing I'm having the Comfort the way I
shot Arjun R when my brother produced the same thing it's a lot more money inv
world but other than that it's it's trust and comfort and understanding so
what else you want you know like so I thought so that's the reason like we doing multile know extraordinary
music score I think every I think Arjun Wy is is one of the I think it's one of one of the fin songs
that I've heard in the longest period of time and the way it has been picted I think it is Artistic the way it's
extraordinary I think it's totally totally amazing um and using an Iranian song for for Bob's
Anthem I'm sure that you must have curated that even Arjun Valle um Manan told me that how how you guys
collaborated together uh other other songs as well I think you have you have an amazing sense for for for for romance
as well um background score too is is is outstanding how crucial is music for you
see as I told one of the interviews also that I I can't imagine without atmosph sound or a Foy or a s sound effect or a
music something has to be there for me to figure out what I'm writing I think
that is the reason for me it takes time for me to finish a script cuz I can't go ahead if I don't know what kind of music
I'm playing because when the a fight is happening I knew the cousins were standing back I wanted a song
and lip sying song so I wanted a song full rageful
Courageous song that two because guys are from pen I wanted in Punjabi and I
know this film is made in other languages also now so I was thinking when there's a lip sying I can't dub
into T I was searching for a old folk song
and uh we found bubble's song in the YouTube YouTube it had 315 views can you
believe 315 views and it is there on the YouTube from past 5 years same song Same
tune and manes took it another level using beats and abusing piano in between
and all that but the tune and the lyric is there from 5 years nobody noticed the
song i s like what a gem of a song this is then finally I said that I need this
song and we got hold of the man was somewhere in uh Canada she que back to
chandigar I met him in Delhi he came to Delhi from chandigar I told him sir I
Need Your Song and all that so he graciously removed from the YouTube and
uh we added some music and that's it even even the uh Iranian song also
whenever I I write a story I I I I I I have a fold up for everything like Arjun
Ron material animal mood material Spirit mood material I collect some kind of a
mood material for me because it's you need to be self motivated on your own
story your your story should give you the kick from the day one till the release of the film through the process
of this two years or 3 years or four years whatever time you are in the film in the story that has to motivate you so
that you are pursuing the making of the film so for that you do great visuals
you need uh you have to think about who is playing this character collect the actors photographs so I do a lot of
research on that so I I found this music somewhere on the YouTube uh Iranian song the moment I got
the song I just thought this is a song for the introducing a villain I don't
know why I felt the moment I heard I I was I just imagine Bobby
so and suddenly one day I visited in the between the shoot then I was figuring
out what was that song then I forgot song then I open my laptop then I saw it coll up somewhere it is there
then I removed it then uh while shooting also we were playing on the speaker
then we have modified little to you know to the sound was a little low because
it's a YouTube quality so we update little up so that's how that song came
and uh even the marati song I was uh I
was uh going to Goa from Bombay we were we were driving from Bombay to Goa and
shapur poni uh radio play I was playing radio in the car so songing when we were
driving so that caught my attention it has some kind of a tune some kind of a
beat which was I The Moment I Saw even same thing like it's a first instinct with music I thought like
action and I always imagin Freddy character as a mar character I don't know why I imagine a marati character so
this is a marati song it's going well with it so I figured out it's A's music and some music company I think Z has it
and Son Z and we got the permission and we used it and even the starting Roa
theme in Arjun RI audio function the Tori band was playing some music when
the crowd is coming and sitting filling the auditorium so I I I saw I looked at
them they they they too good with the work so I remember they played some
rahman's tracks I said like great I mean like ma as one kid I
said then I I saw another music of them in the YouTube then I call them so they
I know them D since ENT ready time so I said like dude you know you come and you also act in the scene and I want to use
that piece because in that when rir comes and dances in the first scene
trior band was actually playing uh the music the chin chin Asha so like that
like for even for Arjun also I had few ideas about how the music has to be so
maybe I was I'm very particular about what music I want to use in particular scenes so that's why it is very uh yeah
hard hting yeah no absolutely uh because and you know the best part is many of times in films certain sort of music is
used certain sort of dialogues are used to cater to certain cultures and and and and regions so that uh you can you can
get certain amount of audience from that particular region but knowing you and and the and the honesty that you
have I'm I'm I'm very sure about the fact that that you are more um Criterion
for for selection is that you like something rather than thinking marati audience
audience I don't think having known you for some time that and that honesty is something that is is is is beautiful as
far as you're concerned Arjun Valley if we're talking about the picturization
that's the first communication the the ax communication was the first communication of animal that came out of
ranir yes yes and the pr and that was very very powerful yes very powerful so
how did you how did you conceptualize that entire sequence because song is one part of it but the entire entire entire
mood the way it has been captured I feel it it's an it's it's an artistic stick piece in itself yeah because see see I
wanted I wanted it to be a heavy Action episode in the interval because I want I wanted the hero to be uh wounded and you
know pissed with bullets and ax mans so for that to happen I thought like it has to have some particular length and
uh Supreme suar Master composed the entire fight so I I told him like we'll
dissect like wave one wave two wave three and way one was a marati song and
there's a break where they're doing the first a and suddenly you see these people come with the skull caps so I
thought there's there's a dialogue there's a little little kind of a scene in between there's a break there's a music I thought that 18 19 minutes will
be fully you know audience I I I was very sure that I can hook the audience
without getting bored and uh that's what happened I mean that's purely a uh what is required for the film and it's one
it's I think one 47 minutes first half and so many of them said
that I think that's that's the biggest compliment I mean they did they did find
the ab time and when it is 3 hour 21 minutes you know
like you know you are doing the film with a kind of Madness but don't imagine it's three including the news real and
all that AK Kumar's s and everything it's 3:23 the r time is 3:23 so yeah right anel
kapor sir told me that um he thinks ranir Kapoor is tall Raj Kapoor um how do you look at his his his
Devotion to his Craft um he can put on weight he can lose weight he can look like a teenager he can look like a
40-year-old um he can he can he can uh he can grow here he can he can just cut
cut here um he can do um um love making scenes U without any any inhibitions
without uh the fear of being judged um he can he can mouth dialogues um
believing in in the vision of his director and not worrying about how he can possibly be judged um how do you
look at this this particular devotion um of an actor I feel his his focus and
attention is at another level is a very effort and and I
II is doing a lot of processing to get into the character I felt that process
was very effortless and uh even the transformation was very
effortless so he was very keen sometimes you know you know he said like S I need
another 15 days the way you want me to look in the note scene I think we need 15 days more so he was very particular
in everything he's like a you know uh to to simplify it you
know passion interest F and I think that's the only
answer and the one best quality is like he'll never Jed you saying I don't think
so this scene should be like this or this D should be written that way he'll never you'll never hear
say I don't think so it's always I understood that it's always whenever I
said anything to him uh he'll think why he's saying
that why sandip is saying this and why SS
balir should say this dialogue he was always with the character he was not judging the film or the character or the
dialogue from an outside perspective Ang
perspective so he's always into the character with the film with the filmmaker I think that the reason this
film is possible if if a Personal Agenda of actor comes into
picture and uh when I narrated a line like 10
minutes 15 minutes after 78 months I narrated like three and a half hour story so when I
narrated the line when he said yes unknowingly when I was sitting on the treatment and the scenes it has the
story I was just writing for him uh more than uh
without Imagining the face of the actor I didn't write because I know that he's doing the film so if you don't want if
you want to stop the process also he'll come into your mind because you know that he's going to do it eventually so that's a very different process which
has happened for this film yeah because when I was writing arju I didn't know that VI will do okay now uh ramu told me
that in the last 110 years of of Indian Cinema since Raja Harish Chandra he's not seen uh such an amazing performance
the way be kapor has uh inhibitionless performance and extraordinary performance um do you do you do you
conquer with them how do you how do you respond to because I think it's a huge statement to make
yeah I want to believe that uh but but since it's my film if I say that
you know you'll feel but I genuinely feel uh that every
every frame every bit every scene every shot he was in the character he didn't
drift at all I didn't see uh he was away from the character right from the school
scene when he is holding the rifle and going into the classroom from that scene till the Old Man scene he was with the
character even the way he played the butcher even that was very uh
outstanding the way the way he didn't take much time also to transform it's like we we I spoke to him I I thought
like R I think we should have this kind of hairstyle we should have a little denture and we'll have a we'll have a
spotshot you know skin will be like little pinky skin about discuss Kia and
look test Kia and next day we were on the set simple and the way he was walking also
like you know when you have the sh with the knives when he's walking you will not guess that and the way he was
walking you know the walking style is completely different so so he just got into it just like that within two
days discuss shooting it's like that yeah how
do you look at the performance of of of rash Maka see well you know what I figured out is when she was dubbing in
telu uh in Canada I figured out some she's more comfortable in Hindi now and
I thought while we were shooting she'll take a lot of time to get the lines but
uh she got it uh she just got it like that when we're changing the lines also on set sometimes
I change lines on on set so and um I think
uh I strongly believe that she understood ganali
character because the way she was emoting she was she behaved like
literally like a wife who was you know in support with the Alpha Man knowing
him from the school days that was very much tangible and visible that's what I felt when I was making the
film I don't know even I I didn't ask her how did you prepare and all but I
strongly believe that she believed in Ran sing balir not as a character as
rashmika Mand also I felt she understood R sing balir that's the reason I thought
like the performance was really good
because any actor when they perform
a little of their character and little of the character which the writer director
writes so when I think like that yeah she she got it
right you know South Indian
actor uh the the you know they very good
together I mean the units of fish pairing you know yeah no I think it also
stems from the director as well because I think the way you have um handled the entire Punjabi element uh in in in the
film is is something it is so seamless because many times uh there tends to be that this entire um I think situation
where this maybe the South Indians may may not understand the nuances of of say North Indians or say punjabis but here
it is spot on it is very very seamless which is which is brilliant um tripti di
um came as a complete surprise has become the latest national Crush how do you respond to trp's extraordinary
response yeahp because see see we wantedly didn't use the song in the
promotion what uh trailer maybe we just used for one shot so in the story also
she'll come at a point where nobody expects another new character to come there's another new Love Story which
which almost we reaching the climax so this there are little odd facts that
also helped the entry of the character and uh she was uh also a very uh you know um
very spontaneous uh actor for example if she has prepared some for for some ex
emotion and if you come in change right away in front of the C camera in between the takes said I don't want this I want
completely diagonally opposite of what you're doing and she would shift like that that that she did it like a pro I
mean that that quality actually was you know which I never thought I thought like now we both work Ley I mean like we
have to shoot a longer period but it just happened like that so things like that really uh you know help the
character also and uh we could uh complete the shoot on time also and it's it's a lengthy dialogue when when she
confuses you know in the pre-climax to or that you know she's a so that's a
long dialogue and most of the time I short on a single short I was changing the uh frame and length and I was always
taking the entire R in a single shot and I was shifting in the edit but
when when I was shooting I wanted in in one flow because it will help the edit when you shi to other shot also because
it's a lot of emotion she's crying and emoting so that was that was
brilliant yeah right and um lots and lots of I think um expectations from
Animal Park U if it releases tomorrow it'll become like a bigger hit that maybe animal too many too many questions
when are you starting Animal Park I'll start after I finish uh spirit so yeah we want I thought like
it's better to give that kind of Gap and uh probably I'll start in uh uh end of
26 or uh middle of 26 and we'll see yeah
2026 you're also having a film with ALU Arjun I believe yeah but the uh nothing is
concrete as of now but we mutually very much interested in working with each other so yeah that's there but it it
will take time little time yeah yeah [Music]
yeah we'll quickly end this interview with a short rapid fire please okay
animal in a hashtag for you hashtag anything for father okay um if you have to Define ranir Kapoor's performance in
a word or sentence outstanding [Music] mindblowing superb brilliant it not one
word there's so many adjectives yeah and I'm a fan
yeah right how much credit will you give to the screenplay of animal screenplay treatment uh you know I I can't dissect
and give a percentage but it played a major role it it really played a major role n regular linear screen yeah best
compliment that you've received for animal so far uh and
uh uh heik s messaged and mahes b s spoke on phone R sir everything was best
I'm not trying to be Diplomat because all of them said different things in anujin and even
ramcharan chj s they all they all spoke a lot about the film so yeah right your
favorite song of animal uh arent really and
P and the climax B there lot I mean like like all the
three songs and papa Maran yeah okay if you have to choose between
either or or two options Arjun your personal favorite
arjuni papan papan okay rashmika y di the biggest
national crush of India right now oh see rashmika is a national CL of
India and uh for sure and now I think know uh she's on the rise of the
popularity dpy so yeah I'm happy for both of them
kapap which is more attractive uhab Kabir saying your animal film
closer to your heart uh Arjun
ready Masala do CH uh ch masal
ranir kapor the younger younger ranir Kapoor or the the the middle-age ranir
kapor both man even the old man all versions of ranir Kap
there right Shah ruk Khan in Jawan Shah ruk Khan in patan ah Shah ruk Khan in
Jawan yeah it is so interesting that in in my interview four years back you said
that you would want to see Shah ruk Khan in an action mode the way he was in Ram Jan and and earlier films and when when
patan and Javan they became a success that that clip was shared a lot people would love to see you working with yes
yeah I would love to I would love to I I have uh if I get a chance uh I think
it'll be great I'll definitely do I don't know when but uh yeah what is your
all-time favorite film well there are a lot of films uh maybe uh one flu or cuu
List Shang Redemption and there are lot of films in Tel but you would
your alltime favorite actor all right your all-time favorite
actress uh I'm
M great uh true or false following statements screenplay is the backbone of any film yes film critics are irrelevant
yes relevant see Irrelevant in terms of in terms of what in terms of success or
in terms of how a filmmaker will take it depends the question it depends for the success of the film uh if if it is
average if it is a small film which is coming with a limited expectation and the critics can kill the film and it is
animal they couldn't touch it you know it depends on what the size of the film was the expectation of the film also so
you have to be very specific when you ask this question so yeah
I was stressed by the negative criticism of animal I was not stressed at all but I was uh irritated by seeing they're
talking only on again A exibit A and exibit B and that's it the same thing no
change to um respect from audience is everything respect for from audience is
you know sincerely coming to the theater not about the money the time because I I
noticed uh we had shows in Bombay at 2:00 in the night so Monday morning
he'll go home at 6:00 that never happened for any of the film I heard so that was brilliant for
few days 24 into 7 the shows were running 6:00 show 7:30 there were shows
which I never heard in Bombay I used to see that in South a lot
but I feel superb about it yeah now this
there was there was a five 30 a.m. show as well 1:00 a.m. 2: a.m. and then 5:30
a.m. shows okay I'm I'm misunderstood but I don't have to clarify myself to anyone uh I feel I want to but now I
feel like uh you know they're deaf so there's no
point I don't think so I have to CL because that I figured out now during
Kabir sing I used to feel that I have to explain them but then now it's pointless Prime aim of Cinema is entertainment
yes a BCD but a is entertainment and slash
entertainment make sure you don't bore the audience that's that's PR don't bore the
be fact you say anything yeah say anything on screen but never bore the
audience screen but it is boring then there's no point if you can't hold the audience attention it's useless then
that that's what I believe amazing uh sandip thank you very much for your time it was like amazing talking to you um
congratulations for the success of um of animal uh your birthday I believe is coming up it's on 25th December yes yes
yes yeah so happy birthday to you in advance thank you so much and thank you so much for having me here and uh as
