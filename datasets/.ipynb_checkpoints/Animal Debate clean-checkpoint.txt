so good evening this is the big debate that we're having today when a filmmaker makes a film should that film take responsibility for influencing young people and for messaging and for the morality that is putting out or within the sort of um framework of freedom of speech and expression that we all enjoy in this country should filmmakers be allowed to make what whatever film they want.
now to begin with the censor board or or uh the board of film controls actually does a category where it says that okay this film should only be viewed by adult so it should only be viewed by those above the age of 12 or 16 as the case maybe we're talking about the film animal the sense support has decided that it should only be viewed by adults and it's done its job freedom of speech and expression allows the director to make whatever he wants to make and he has decided to make perhaps the most violent film we've seen in recent times but there's been a lot of criticism about the glorification of misogyny the ideas the violence for violence sake that's in this film and the impact that it will have on young people who tend to really mimic and sort of follow what Bollywood shows them which is why we're having this conversation and uh we have like a really cool set of people that we put together uh to sort of understand uh what all of this means in terms of the impact on youth to begin with um one of my favorite people sucharita tagi is a film critic and who sort of been very
vocal about films and you know the portrayal of women the portrayal of
relationships towards women the language used and this kind of misogyny that gets glorified so I'm very happy she's had
the time to join us KV shria or pops he's commonly known for those of us in the entertainment industry is a veteran
hand of at advertising and messaging with a very modern outlook on what's Happening in our society uh Mr Sanji heg
is a senior advocate of the Supreme Court and it's I'm really happy that Mr heg decided to join us because there's a
legal point of view here as well freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right in India um and with
some exceptions so we want to understand um you know if everything in this film is really allowed within that framework
nikel tja is the co-founder and the chief of we yua uh he runs this really cool show called uh just be a man where
he talks about what it is like uh you know to be a man U and what the expectations are in society and a lot of
this film is in that space that NC deals with on his show so he's been kind enough to join us as well thank you all
of you for joining us I'm going to start with Sanjay heg because I'm going start
the jumping off point of what the law allows us so Mr heg a film that's gory
it's violent it's misogynistic it's disrespectful of women um there
apparently there is one one scene where he walks into a high school because he feels his sister's being treated badly
with a gun and fires it in the air just to send a message does freedom of speech and
expression and the current framework of our law allow for this sort of thing well a freedom of speech has to
mean anything it is freedom of speech for what you do not want to hear or what
you do not want to see popular speech requires no
protection it is unpopular speech that you dislike but you still
have to allow and here the framework as far as films is concerned is set by the
sensor board the sensor board uh looks at uh whatever aspects under its
censorship code and then certifies films for release yes it can't you cannot
require that the sensor board also be a sensor of people's morals or messages
that go out on Films because then you are it's the thin end of the wge
supposing the sensor board says that you know this is not a proposition that the
public at large should be uh subjected to or will will accept the sensor board
is not a sensor of public tastes so if a filmmaker gets his film
certified by the sensor board and it is exhibited in accordance with that there
there ends the debate you are of course free to criticize the film yes that's
also freedom of speech you are free not to view the film all all those things come entire
you are even free to protest outside the theater as far as the film is concerned
without resorting to violence that too is freedom of
speech approach the court saying I find this film too violent you should not be
shown you you could possibly challenge the certification by the sensor board
saying that look if the sensor board had set out these particular norms and
ignored them then that's a pure administrative law question that if you
set out the law and you do not follow the law then follow the law but if the sensor board having a applied the law
then certifies the fill then you can't say that you know it
does not uh fall within my preferred taste or this is not how it should be
allowed just give let me uh conclude by giving you one example these questions
did come up in the Bandit Queen if you remember the film there was a very
violent rape of fand Devi which was shown but that was was integral to the
fandi story yes and you could not have had uh that
film or that impact without that rape scene you you you saw a man's buttocks
bare buttocks on the screen uh as that rape was
committed so possibly that shot could have been uh uh edited by the director
or could have been shot in another another way or shown in another way but that is
the director's Vision it it is the vision of the entire
creative unit and uh that was allowed to stand by the
Supreme Court itself so taste let me this yeah yeah
let me take this question for the rest of our panel yes um SAR I will start with you what is
the problem with the film animal according to you the problem is not the violence the problem is uh not even the
misogyny the problem is not the story the problem is not anything the problem is the Gaze F the problem is the um the
the the justification of of things right we are adults the the sensor board said
that this is a film for adults adults go and watch it uh violence is you it's not
like this is the first time we've seen a human being cut open by an ex it's fine
you know that kind of stuff whoever wants to tell their story tells the story the way they want to tell it and
the conversation isn't about whether someone should be allowed to make a certain kind of film or should not be
allowed to make a certain kind of film we live in a free country that like s said if we start going down that road
it's a slippery slope you cannot tell filmmakers what kind of films they can or cannot
make what this conversation is about is the larger discourse around the film and
the push back criticism of the film um receives it's like there is a status quo
that we must adhere to that this is a movie star and these are big people making his big budget film and his face
still on the stream I'll just take over the show so hey guys welcome this is the saari show
now um yes so anyway until Fay comes back I
can just carry on talking about animal uh so yeah what I was saying to everyone who's here still I face she's back the
question is not about whether sandep should beow allowed to make this film whether ranir should be acting in such a
film the question is about the Gaze with which the film is made and the conversation and the criticism is about
what the film is uh propagating what the film is forgiving of um and what the
film is uh you know meant to uh titilate there's always a way um you know you and you can see it in the in the convers
around the film before it even released uh the intention with which um you know
this story has been put out in the world so that is the larger conversation I would actually I would
actually argue here we watched as kids we watched Rambo um you know first
experience with sort of a machine gun we saw Bruce Willis say y i you know
whatever and then you know jump off a building and fire at people this is which is all you know we all we saw GI
Jo um as as young adults we saw the Joker which was you know which which messed
with a lot of our heads how is that different from this uh pop same question to you do you see a problem with animal
or are you off the view that hey you know what they've made a film don't like it don't watch it no I don't have a
problem um because creative people are free to express you know tell stories it
is no fun um or no brainer uh if you were to not include a twist in the
character um correct it's all about characterization if you actually look at the film it's a one liner relationship
between a son and a father which is boring nobody would go to theaters if you actually say you know the complexity
of the characters and the way they have been portrayed and uh that is what that
is what makes today's stories you know earlier story means a biopic you know from X to Y today know you just take the
complex characters and then you tell a small narrative it's not a story it's a
small event but you dramatize everything else and then the trend of
um actually know lack of story lack of insight lack of something else in uh and
then hiding behind um too much of violence you know too much of uh um of
goriness when it is appropriate it's fine you know as San said you know if it
is you know that that is serious enough to be shown to the audience to get the story and then to get the emotions fine
so there are two things you know one morally uh and then Legally Legally
they fine you know the expert have spoken you know legally nobody can do anything but morally every story writer
you know when they face with a white paper they can write the story which they want to
write correct and this is what um um I'm a member of ASI
board self-governance you know leaving it to the creative people who are writing the stories to their imagination
and then to their own value systems what kind of story you want to write and then how do you want to narrate the story if
you look at you know it started with wasur but wasur did not have as gory
details as it has today uh on OT um but you know somewhere you know the
line needs to be drawn because all the content today um is all set in goriness
you know I have no problem in a torano also does films which has got violence but uh um but it is just a competition
that who can do you know I can chop five fingers and then bloodstream you know
comes out of as five fountains you know we were quite perplexed you know when we saw somebody chopping the head and then
still bloody oozing out of that so now you know it's a matter of you know how many organs you you chop and how many
streams of blood it will come out so we used to have a horror JRE completely When We Were Young you know whether it
is right right correct and then you go and then see this gory thing of hands
being chopped and then legs being chopped it's fine you're mentally prepared to do that but you know there
is something you know which we all do um when we actually do something which influences millions of people and then
we think twice what you want to put and what you don't want to put yeah in fact on that on that note I just want to
bring in um nikil nikel can you tell me now we've talked a lot about and such said it's the Gaze it's the messaging
that we send out it's what we glorify as acceptable behavior um when this person
says U oh you have the hips to Bear an alpha and that is why I will marry you
or um you know earlier the alphas would go out and hunt and the women would look after the children and they would just
marry more alphas and have more alphas and this this whole idea what is from a
social point of view why is that problematic in your opinion you know I'm going to add to
such's point I feel um anyone should be allowed to make any film that they want
right because as Sara said and as Mr s and everyone's been saying over here uh
the moment we start policing what films can or cannot be made uh then we are in a dangerous Society in any case there
are people who file Fs in our country against things that they don't like in
movies so you might have a Bombay bams which is a series where uh you know they've shown a teenager um you know
experimenting with her own sexuality and someone's filed a case against that under posco and um what do you say to
this right and this is just one case I Canan there are many many such cases so uh I don't think that the right way of
looking at any film is to censor or to say that um you know this can and cannot
be made every film is valid as an expression of the filmmaker that is making it and uh the story that they
want to see uh it is the lens that it comes down to and the lens should be seen in not just the context of what the
film represents but also in the context of where we are in uh as a culture where
we are as a society um I I put out a tweet recently that said that the difference between a film about a toxic
character and a toxic film is the intent of the filmmaker um I haven't seen
animal you know I mean I don't have like unlike sucharita I don't have the burden of having to watch every film uh your as
it releases and I can choose not to watch a film that I don't think represents a kind of value system that I want to see on screen uh having said
that I know that the film filmmaker himself s angari has multiple times gone
uh you know in interviews and spoken about that the fact that this film is an answer to his critics this film is made
to make a point this film is made to trigger this film is made to be provocative and when you're are doing um
when you're showcasing something on screen just to make a point to people
who don't like you and that point is being made through misogyny and that point is being made through excessive
violence if that point is being made through a certain value system that tries to Showcase that there is a
certain kind of a man that is cool to watch it's not that the film again you
know and and he's he's playing with us right like because he's called the film animal so the fact is that yes there is
a film where the person the character in it is supposed to be animalistic at the same time the film also has really cool
music it has this banging background music that I you know there's this great soundtrack that is
that it has anytime that there is something problematic that is being shown on screen it is being shown
through a really cool soundtrack which almost goes on to say that you must like
this uh this this moment that you must almost clap at this moment that this is
not an animal moment or a villain moment but a hero moment and then I keep sharing from everyone who's gone on to
theaters to watch this film that they were shocked or maybe POS possibly
unsurprised that people are clapping when a misogynistic line is is being said or they're clapping when something
terrible happens on screen or they're laughing at it and that's the problem with with a film like this right it is
the intent of the filmmaker it is the it is the lens with which this film is being made and it is being done only to
Showcase that I can do this and and you can't do thing about it because if you
do something about it if you complain about it then I can point to all the so to speak woke uh films that you have
made and I can say why is this okay and why is this not okay and that's where we are at and we need to kind of view all
of these films from the lens of unfortunately how they're going to be consumed by a society that anywh at this
point of time believes that you know we are still a very patriarchal Nation we're still a nation that where a lot of
this gender conditioning and a lot of men are being told that uh being Alpha is actually the right way of being or
being an ideal man really means being a bully sometimes being an angry man sometimes you know treating the women in
your lives the way any way that you possibly can Andrew Tate is a huge hero for a lot of people and not just outside
in the world also in India so in a social context like that should we be making films like this just to make a
provocative point just to Showcase that just to trigger uh people who want to
see a certain kind of value system in the culture around us not in the films I think that's really the the issue that
we're dealing with over here in fact um it's this is really important point a lot of people might not know that you
know back in the day when we used to watch these old Hindi films and someone would die would be this soundtrack that would inform you as the audience it's
now to time to feel sad I would go like that right so what n's pointing out is
really important the soundtrack informs you that this is something to celebrate but going back to what he said which is
the director of the film animal had said very clearly that oh you think this is violent after uh Kabir S I will show you
what a violent film really is the next ones would be super violent um so jarita is with us what's argued that was in
response to your review where you said that Kabir Singh was really violent tell us what happened is this is this your
fult did you bring this on girl
look I am not going to give myself credit many please please that
that is a conversation that if someone wants to have in the comment section by all means go ahead and have it I would
not in my wildest dreams have the freaking um you know
lack of self- awareness to be like I I am so influ
influential having said that Anis com anything it could be my
tweet it could be my Instagram post it could be my review on YouTube any conversations that I'm having with journalist like yourself or other women
it is uh you know filmmakers are going on in saying that you should not look at
a piece of art through your own morality don't impose your own morality on someone else's piece of art you always
impose your own morality on piece on Art yeah it could be any format of art it could be a painting a painting will move
you because of what is inside you not just because what is in the uh in the in the on the canvas uh a song will move
you because of what it touches inside you similarly a film will activate your emotion because of what is already
inside you so what um I have spoken about the film is what is already inside me you know violence is one thing but
what who is the violence being committed upon and is the is are those acts of violence being justified as heroic or
are they being show to show a the craft of action choreography is not a problem
action choreography is great it's a very skillful thing for a filmmaker and uh you know St coordinators to achieve on
screen um but it's it's the it's the larger picture of it when you look at it as a painting when you take a take five
steps back and you sit in that Museum and you spend time looking at it what it evokes within you what it evokes within
me is a very feminist response because that's just who I am as a person and that's what who all of us should be but
um you know like nikil was also saying a couple of minutes back it is not
about how dare he make something like that or how dare she say what she said it's about the and Cinema is so complex
it is such a complex art form because it's got visuals it's got audio it's got edit it's got music it's got dance it
got it's got action so all the other art forms are encompassed in a in a in one
single frame and every second is 24 frames we need to have more conversations around what what it means
um you know like more critical conversations around Cinema in general are required in our country I
think taking this back to sanj heg sanj has really been a bit Mr he there's the
legal framework also and there is the moral responsibility because um you know
Bollywood makes what is effectively can we say a mirror to society and so when we're making films
where it shows a young person walking into a school with a gun is there a risk in your mind you
know that we might be encouraging gun violence because we're looking across the world at another country at the US
for example where gun violence in school is a real problem should there be in your opinion a sort of moral
responsibility on film makers to say hey is that something I should be doing should I be encouraging
that well then if they're filmmakers they are not moralists they are not
religious leaders so each one comes with his own set of morals you may make a very
violent film and yet have uh the moral of the film should could very well be
that violence doesn't work uh do they owe a
responsibility well I I think that too is a slippery
slope because okay let me let me push this let me push the legal argument little better I always do when I'm
talking to you the courts have also at the same time argued that Bollywood superstars who endorse products um also
people on the on on Instagram who are influencers who endorse products should be held to some extent uh responsible
for the quality of what they're endorsing they can't just be do it with impunity which is hey you know I'm not
really manufacturing it I'm just endorsing it so they get in and out that's that's you know one argument as well does that level of influence then
translate also to the films that they're making well that is a tricky question
let me let me put it this way when you endorse or influence
somebody body else's product then in a in a sense you are
taking a certain ownership of it but when you are putting your own work
out for the world to judge they you you're essentially saying
judge me this is not a message this is my
particular vision of of the way that I tell this story I have submitted supposing I'm an
author for instance forget films I write a very very violent
book now as long as it does not fall within an incitement to violence or
any of the other prohibited sections I'm still able to uh I'm I I
should be able to publish that book so when some submits his film his book or
maybe even a painting for the Judgment of the public he or
she does not tell the public that uh look you have to follow
it this is a vision that I'm communicating you use your own judgment
on it I think I I think that is where that's where I join issue with suchar on
the Gaye part of it there are people with all kinds of
gazes and when you you are submitting your art and your point of view to the
public say that this is my gaze I know that some of you are going to hate it and that's what the director
said you may you may hate it you may get triggered but this is within the
law this is my point of view you if you if you like it and you
pay and you pay to come into the movie theater and and endorse it so be it if I
if you don't like it but you still come to the movie theater to think about it
so be it my duty is to say that such a vision
is possible and that is the vision that I'm communicating I don't think that there
is a further responsibility
legally for any particular causality so Char you want to respond to
that that everyone has a gaze and everyone's free to put that gaze out as yeah absolutely everybody has a gaze
everybody will put their gaze out because if you're the uh what product you're creating any art form it could be
if it doesn't have your gaze then what is it you're not manufacturing it in a factory every song every poem Every liit
every film it comes from a human person from a human point of view from a from their own lens on Humanity to Gaz
obviously legality is not something that I would debate at all like it's it can't
be illegal to make films again because like tja was saying nikil was saying a few minutes ago uh if you already
there's Al so much legality that gets involved when filmmakers try to express their Creative Vision through their
craft
and uh like Mr HG was also just saying it's like an advertisement isn't it what
are actors doing actors are marketing the film actors actors are agreeing to be a part of the film actors are
agreeing to the message of the film that's why they're participating in the film uh when big movie stars say that I'm not or big Sports people say that
we're not going to endorse sugary soda drinks because they are not good for your body and it's not something that we
actively drink or consume in our real lives we will not endorse it it's similar isn't it actors are also
endorsing uh value proposition of the you know or or the values of the the
film that they are participants in they cannot be separated from the film saying
this this is someone else's Vision not mine I'm just acting can I can I just make one
distinction there yes see when a sports person
uh endorses a fizzy drink or a pan parag or something like
that then that is a product which somebody else has made which has been tested by the market
or you know about the and then you are endorsing it despite everything often
when a film film actor signs a project he starts off with a script he see he
sees a character that he he has has to enact but the ultimate Vision as to how
it comes out the Gaze there is very little kind of control that the actors
themselves have the the responsibility as such the would be more likely to be that
of the producer as well as the Director very often see listen I as a lawyer I
get a brief last minute all that all that look at is what
is the best possible argument that I can make or what is the best possible performance I can give I am not
necessarily endorsing the uh the character of the
client no but Mr I don't want to disagree with you on that point I mean films tend to be now
three four year projects and especially the lead male um you know you know actor
on the film has a tremendous amount of agency on how he's portrayed what he
looks like what he says and what that character builds in if I'm not mistaken so Chara do you want to rebart on on any
of those yeah it's uh again you know uh a film is not a a a new flavor that you
be like I don't know how this flavor tastes films have flavors and those flavors are tried and tested and um you
know since time in Memorial because at the end of the day film are films are human stories and every actor who is
getting a script to say that they don't understand how this script is portraying their character is to infantilize the
actors and take away the responsibility from them so I would disagree with that
politely you would understand see listen you would understand the character but how would the entire story
gel together it's very unlikely I mean amjad Khan as gabber saying let's take
it we would be a different gab Singh from what Danny denzongpa who was
originally slated for that character would would have been he may put in what what he has but
would he endorse would he have had agency over how the ultimate product
came over the chol itself had two separate
endings there was one ending which didn't work and and an ending which got
you but I do I do believe that zanika Bollywood and this zanik Bollywood is
completely different um actors get final sign off if I'm not mistaken on almost
everything especially the male actors but um anyone who wants to you know pops
do you want to take that yes go ahead yeah I mean I mean the comparisons were slightly different between actors uh
working in a film versus uh models or the celebrities who are endorsing
products correct and um I mean one comparison I I totally agree with Sanjay
um is you very well know um and what the product is and if it is legally allowed
to be sold and marketed there is no legal issues you sign correct and then
if you the trouble comes if you don't understand the legalities of it and then
you flaunt and then you put something without a thing saying that you are endorsing without people knowing that
you as a celebrity paid celebrity endorsing that's where you are going to mislead the people and advertising lot
of this influencer advertising will fall into that misleading people as if you
personally are endorsing while you are taking money to say the product is good so therefore you know that's a different
comparison as far as films are concerned you know everyone knows um that where
the film is headed what kind of film will be made you know at least the lead actors you know extras will not know too
much about you know how the film is going to be treated and nobody takes away from the
legality or the right of a director or a writer a story writer or an actor to
express himself freely in in that particular role if it is a guy who is
differently wild and then you are portraying his life and he will do all the Wild Things who because he's
differently where it gets affected is is if the
viewer does not know that he's not a normal human being he differently differently wide he's a psychopath so as
long as people get to know that what the plot is then they will take the right moral out of that that is one part you
know most of the fil at the end of the film you will know that you know is a villain or is a hero or what he is done
is good or bad the second uh part is legally there is absolutely nothing you
cannot ask anybody to stop expressing themselves but there is a something
called morality you know which you put filters you know as creative people we always put that filter because when you
are starting with an idea you know you know how realistically you want to make how authentically you wanted to make how
hyperbolic you know you can make and then can do you want to take it to a sexist level you know by by um taking
the mail protagonist in in a certain way so all the options are available in your
head before writing a script you exercise which one is correct um to your
own conscious you know we in advertising we do what is right for the brand you know here we have to exercise what is
right to my own conscious you know what is the kind of story which I want to tell people and then influence people
with my stories so that is where where the filter need to be applied by
creative people themselves you know nobody can force or enfor enforce them to to to have that filter later or to
crucify them and then that is the only thing you know as a creative person who have
been creative people Pops I want to you know there's there's a clip of an interview that ahed Khan gave many years
ago that is now doing the rounds in which he has effectively said that he believes that using either violence so
sex extensively in a film indicates to a lack of talent and creativity on the
part of director because because these are the two base emotions it's very easy
uh you know to use that but to use like complex emotional ideas uh to build complex characters is far more difficult
and it's when someone lacks creativity that they resort to using violence and sex to sort of promote
their these are all cliches and low hanging fruits which you resort to you
know all the films and all the stories are blazed on either hyperbolic or a conflict now what is the conflict which
is happening how do I resolve it your intelligence lies in picking the resolution you know how are you going to
resolve you know that is where this entire thing whether you
take first I understand Mr he has to leave Mr do you want to just quickly make a closing point before you
go the closing point is that the law recognizes that it has
limitations and if it is within the law you cannot necessarily apply the same
moral standard to everyone people have different morals as long as you do not
seek to forcibly uh impose your morals on on
anybody else or uh you know some
manipulate their morons I think I think people you you should allow people their
full say thank you very much f for having me thank you Mr for I can't yes I
I wish you could stay longer you know I just want to I just want to point out sucha made a really interesting uh sort
of analogy where she talked about U Sports people not endorsing phys drinks right so again there's a very popular
video of the footballer Ronaldo sort of moving all the phizzy drinks away from him in a press conference and finally he
put a you know bottle of water and he said drink water uh the interesting thing about this is there's nothing
illegal with endorsing um fizzy drinks and if someone chooses to do so they're fully within their legal rights to do so
it's the moral stand of whether or not that's a good thing and whether or not that's the message you want to send out
and so everyone associated with a film like this is choosing actively to be
part of that film um nich responding to the Amir Khan statement if this is the the lowest hanging fruit pops also
agreed that people so are we saying then that the 60 CR rup sort of opening is
that the correct number U that this massive opening probably bigger than that probably bigger than that let me
tell you apparently for an a-rated film this was the largest opening ever it was ranir Kapoor's largest Opening Ever 61
CR on the first day second biggest opening of the year after patan um
biggest for the director s ranga biggest non- festive opener so it's done really
well because of this low hanging fruit uh again I mean I don't know if
this is honestly a low hanging fruit because Amir himself did kajani and he obviously made the statement much before
that and and also will Amir make that statement now as the industry stands
today as his relationships and all our relationship with Cinema stands today where he's announced a film with s right
after G to will he make that statement now yeah yeah and and uh absolutely and you know the thing is that if you look
at also I mean I don't want to um again give my judgment on S Wanga R's art but
at least from the films that I've seen whether it is Skil bill or whether it is the raid you know over there the
violence was craft it wasn't and it was Art it was both it and it served a purpose there was story there was an
emotion emotional truth to it and you can't look at that and say that that is low hanging fruit right uh even uh you
know movies about sex uh uh Sex Lies in videotape as an example by sber is is
one of the best you know Independent films that was made in the '90s and all of them all of them have a purpose for
existence and again I think in in in the mind of the director of this film there is a purpose for this film to exist and
within that film and within that Universe are the people violent yes the context of these people are violent yes
and again you know even when you look at individual scenes like someone mentioned that I think so only mentioned that
there was was a I don't know who Ben but there was a gun that was taken in a school um now of course you know there
are films about school shootings there is something called there's a film called uh we must talk about Kevin uh
and there was a film called The Dirties which is about school shootings and which showed again these kids going and
doing this violence but there was a justification and a purpose and the purpose was to horrify you how wrong
this is my problem again with with films like this and you know I saw Kabir Singh ultimately because I need I wanted to be
part of uh at least wanted to have an opinion you know before I give out an opinion and I possibly might watch
animal also for research purposes but uh um even in Kabir Singh right like the first time when when Shahid and his
character Kabir comes into a college and puts his hand on a woman and says you
know she's mine and you know to another guy who wants her you know and there is a very cool banging soundtrack to it and
you know and you know that the point of this is that this is a cool thing to do and the moment you are kind of trying to
make everything look like a cool thing because that is the moral stance that you're taking that's the problem the
fact that there is you know today someone put out a thread that even when films like d had come out at that point
and this is after shuk himself has said that it is you know he was a villain he
did wrong things he got just you know Justified ending he died Sunny Dale was the bigger hero in fact shuk one of his
clip has gone viral saying that you know when I play a bad guy people somehow I make him
likable somehow so I have to be very careful when I do bad guys and which is why when I play bad guys I don't
disrespect women because I don't want men to look at me and feel like this is a likable thing to do but most other
actors don't think like this and don't have these moral standards when it comes to films because they're looking for the
best part that they can get and within that best part if they get to do terrible things you know and that evoke
reactions they will do it so of course zir has agency of course ashika has agency and you know while they might
while the actresses in that film might have lesser agency than a ran they've all chosen but they recognize that this
film is going to make that 61 CR opening because this is what unfortunately the audience wants and the reason they want
it is because they genuinely believe that these kind of alpha men are cool
and that's what we are having a discourse that they are not actually cool this is just a movie fa you're on
mute I have a dog and a child okay I have to mute myself
on so I want to push this conversation a little further away from the director's responsibility to the mirror that
Bollywood shows our society Are We Now a society and I and I want to also I believe that we've gotten
to this point where we are watching a film like animal where someone's making a film like animal because it it's
responding to the environment like you know an animals if evolve based on the
environment that they're in uh the demands of that environment right and I believe that this is the case as well
let's consider the kind of content that gets put up on YouTube the kind of things that gets
said about women the kind of things that get written about women in the comment section U you know the the sort of world
we live in where this the man who sits in his car and gives GES on on video is
an influencer with a huge following the sort of like gym sort of uh testosterone
driven idea of a man the the going back to the traditional idea of a man pushing
past this all this sort of woke feminist nonsense that you expect us to soften up you expect us to do G you
expect rubbish you know men are always meant to be this and you are always meant to be that and you know there's a
there's a massive push back and this push back is not necessarily only male there's push back coming from women as
well is this a reflection of that push back in our
society right now it is you know it is at one point in time to be metosexual
you know to to be nice and then to to to really respond to things in a modern
Progressive Way and then today men are
threatened men are threatened at the very basic level uh correct they are
seeing women are their bosses they are seeing women you know behaving more than
equals and then suddenly you know if you see not just this film you know last
five years you know you see the list of films which have made it big from South North you know wherever it is Leo pushpa
Vikram kdf rrr Jaya Javan Rana gadar to
and bhagan Singh bhagan Singh kri you know you you you look at all these films
what are the the reflection of the society you know I mean either you can
mirror the society or you can influence the society the choice is yours and then
today's film makers and storytellers are choosing the path of I mirror the
society and mirror is realistic is authentic based on facts because you are
only showing the mirror but you know in this case you know they are not showing mirroring the society they are actually
creating a hyper story you know of one little aspect of something and then
making a story out of it I mean while we can argue and then say that creative people must have the freedom to express
the way they wanted to express tell the stories and most of the stories are relevant to that you know era and then
may not be relevant retrospective to a generation correct it may not be but
having said all that you know somewhere um for the sake of wanting to be
different you know wanting to be original if people start to think about you know how long this me too will
continue of this action and then cruelity crudity you know raw metosexual
I mean raw alpha male behavior in the society and then killing people you know
you a hero fights uh because somebody kills his father he will go and then
kill 5,000 people in the movie if you keep a head count of that correct so
that fine so it's fine to take revenge of one
killing to 5,000 people you know killing in that so all these are hyperbolic things you know which are not really
mirroring the society if you were to mirror revenge and then you go to some extent to to really make that happen and
then you struggle and then do that you know if you have seen Mom you know it has a beautiful story line and it does
you know it's a fiction but it does create that tension in the story telling and also the characters but you know
this has gone little overbo is my opinion while I'm no judge of anybody
somebody else's work if I don't like I don't see but um by and large people who
create content must you know keep a filter uh of their own uh Consciousness
in what they creating you know I just want to bring up in this conversation Andrew Tate right there was research
done about the fact that and for for those of our audience who don't know Andrew Tate is a a sort of um online
content creator who puts out really misogynistic sort of alpha Mele ideas
and is watched by very very young boys and there was research that Kim said that the young boys who happen to follow
him and watch him on the internet also share his misogynistic ideas and in there their sort of treatment of the of
the girls their age is very different and is informed by those videos that they watch and I just want to spend a
minute talking about it and for people in the comment section we'll read out some of the comments sanj he was here we've all you know agreed and
established that freedom of speech is Paramount and nothing really legally is wrong with the film animal we're
discussing its impact on society or we discussing society's impact that has led to a film like animal so Char the
andrate question of that kind of content going up on a regular
basis give me the long answer that's kind of content going up on a regular basis of the internet leading also you
know like pops pointed out the film like rrr which glorified a fictional Freedom
um fighting movement which was fully violent and our freedom uh movement was nonviolent in characteristic but we sort
of you know imagining a different India right now what's your response to
that um look at where rrr went look at how much it traveled look at what it did
for uh not just SS rajali but the actor um the music it one an Oscar comparison
to that if I because I was very heavily um trolled for that review as well
whatever you know you're used to that kind of stuff you're a woman's speaking opinion on the internet hello good
morning um but you know compared to what that film uh the impact of that film and the number of people it reaches and the
number of mes it reaches compared to a channel that is just about hit 100,000 subscribers you it it's not comparable
uh you know so putting everything together you it it's not all cont content it is somebody's making a film
somebody's making a YouTube video somebody's making regular Instagram reals everything has its own life everything has its own reach everything
goes to different different places but that doesn't mean that's Al you know a feedback that people keep giving in my
comment section is if you don't like it don't watch it why why did you go to watch the film if you're not going to like it no if somebody is treating you
badly you're going to say something you're not going to look the other way it's not personally treating me badly
but you know what I'm saying if if if something bothers you you you say something you put you put use your um uh
right of you know whatever freedom of speech in in in in that scenario um
and you
knowbody saying don't make faces how disrespectful imagine live or the the
impunity with which men on the internet operate don't make faces somebody who telling I'm sitting on a freaking news
panel with freaking fade suan somebody's telling me don't make faces live to my face so you know you know Andro knows
who he's making these videos for sandep knows who his film is for in they are
not like silly gullible innocent none of us are silly gullible and innocent we
know what the films are for we know what they are saying and then that's why what we have to say is also has to be that
much calculated say you and I are running our you know things on YouTube on our
own channel we have platformed ourselves who's platforming us our voice our descent our push back to the end rotates
of the world no one we're doing it on our own it's the absolute least as cultural commentators as women who feel
like we have a voice and the vocabulary and the words in whatever language we choose to put that opinion out yeah I
cannot rest if I don't do
it I can't look the other way nonsense while Andrew Tate you know for better of
of us has the ability and the legal right to put out his opinion so does sar
it's and and you know in that in the universe where they both exist but nikil and and you know an understanding of
what messaging is going on from a film like animal and we talked about this I remember when Vikram Singh came out uh
kab sing I'm sorry came out as to what message that sends out this sends out a far clearer message to young boys who
are in high school right now who are going to be like fil you know this is what you what you what in your mind is
that message that's gone out right now and how much pressure are these boys is going to be under to sort of portray
that same you know that same sort of masculine energy yeah I think uh um I
think when we spoke about low hanging fruits right I think we were talking about violence and sex and I think uh
provoking the society into a certain kind of
um Alpha Behavior a certain kind of chest tping uh you know angry bully
behavior is the easiest thing to do actually you know it's far more
difficult and that's where you know uh films like those are tougher to make and
they get made very less because it's very it's far more difficult to evoke uh empathy it is far more difficult to
evoke tears or Humanity from Cinema but it is far easier to evoke provocation or
or anger or irritability or misogyny because those are emotions which are
which actually don't those are base emotions they don't really take as much effort and and the unfortunate thing is
that uh uh because most filmmakers want to obviously also make money because
this is a business you know we keep it art But ultimately there is Commerce involved and most producers and
directors are always looking at the easy way out to make that kind of money versus taking the tougher route and
saying something that is the truth and again I'm not saying that this is not s vangar R's truth in fact it very much
must very much must be and that is also a very a tricky thing to talk about but
uh uh but yeah I don't I think it's a very um if you don't take responsibility as filmmakers at as artists for the art
that we putting out into the world then you know what are we doing with our lives I feel you know honestly like I
feel like um if you have not studied science and not studied Commerce and
fought with your parents to get into the film industry to get into the media industry to call yourself an artist to
write an original story to put your truth out into the world if you're doing all of that ultimately to provoke
someone and show a middle finger to someone and say oh you you got triggered because I showed one woman slapping here I'll show another woman licking
somebody's boot now you tell me what what are you going to say to me I mean when you're doing it for those reasons you know that's the problem I feel uh
you know with films like this and again I'm not at all saying that you know s Angar should not be allowed to make the
film that he wants to make make it but I'm saying that you know it's very easy for filmmakers like that to point out
fingers at everybody else and say oh you got offended but then when we as a response talk about the fact that the
reason this is wrong or the reason it is distasteful according to us is this and
not in the context of the character but in the context of what it is representing to this Society at large then they also get offended right like
then who is getting triggered you're also getting triggered you know and but but when you get offended then your army
of uh you know supporters then you know latch on to us get angry at us you know
call us names uh especially women you know and that's the unfortunate truth to truth to it right most women who are
reviewing this film are being called you look at I mean sucha who has always taken feminist ansers I'm saying even a
senior you know uh journalist today and I've just been seeing their com sections it's all just crash stuff and you know
when you make films like that you kind of almost give a um you know free pass to people to be like well this guy acted
like an animal so it is probably okay for you to as well but it's not and those are the things that if at any
point of time as an example and I just finish this one point Fe if at any point of time uh sandep ranir or anybody
associated with the film would go out and actually say folks this is just a film this is being made only for
entertainment uh this is about an animal this is about a character who behaves like an animal this is not real life
don't take it seriously don't we not endorsing the thing that happens in this
film we have just made it for entertainment even if they say base level things like that I think at least
there should be some sincerity to what they're trying to create but over here that's not the case it's almost in fact
the opposite where it is being said that so what like this exist and you know but rebuttal to that last Point nikil actors
and filmmakers and writers should not have to go out and justify their films once the films are out what they are
saying you shouldn't expect we can't expect this from anyone to be like no no no I let me justify my movie this is my
movie you make of it what you will you already Justified your film the fact that it's out there it's been made for
years in yours it's Justified and I mean it purely on the sense of your uh
accountability and and what you are what is the lens like you said if your lens
actually and your intent actually is not to create something that is is just provocating for the sake of it and that
is just misogynistic for the sake of it you will at least say that out that we have created a bad character like
everyone someone some people are putting threats about Scar and Taxi Driver you know scari for you know has created
killers of the flower wound he's the one who actually stands up and says here's what's wrong with Society he's been
doing that repeatedly over the years he speaks about it all his interviews he speaks about taking accountability for
us creating a you know a society where terrible things happen where terrible exist and and then also explains why
they deserve the end that they deserve because the comments that we get on our reviews especially female film critics
are uh the idea is to shove us off the internet to uh get us to shut up to not
have these ideas to not express these opinions who is responsible for that who is responsible for hundreds and
thousands of people working together to silence uh dissenting opinion that is
the responsibility a film must take absolutely AB bring in a different angle right and and Pops I know you have
something to say and you can respond to this yeah at the end of the day yes if you
give things to young people they will take it correct they are at a rebellious
place and then you know they want you know all the males in the country of that age wanted to be like that it is
like asking children um that do you want chocolates and then you give them free
chocolates as much as you want and then they will lap it up they'll eat eat they will not be they will not know the
repercussion of eating so many chocolates somewhere the mother guides them Society is also like that correct
and then the people who are influences need to have you of course you give violent films you give sexist film you
put you know 12 rapes in a film and then people will go and then watch it it will become Blockbuster correct it will
become a blockbuster it will not 300 CES 700 CES it will correct but what attick
are we are really um uh judging those
you know films so it is not the money which they make it is not the the impact
which you are making and what kind of impact are you making and then you as an individual as an influencer as a writer
and as whatever you are as an individual what impact are you making on people is
it the impact which you want or you want you know some other impact you can you know you can uh you can exaggerate
things to make a point but you can't um shy away from that exaggeration and then
you know and then finally what is the moral which people get it's okay to go
and then kill people it's okay to fight another thing before this panel
right recently there was a film called thank you for coming that was made Bui R kapor it was about a young woman
not having achieved an orgasm and then trying many ways and many partners in order to do so now when the film came
out and this is besides the point of whether it was a good film or a bad film when the film did come out there were
many reviewers on YouTube who were basically saying how can you teach young
girls in the country that they should be going out and having uh you know multiple partners and they should be looking for orgasms and they should be
you know because you're influencing young people and this is the message you're sending out that this kind of you
know um this this is the kind of behavior that young women should indulge in how is
that different from the argument youall are making right
now very good I think we should leave it to
individuals and their Consciousness you know nothing you can do about it the kind of film I want to make I'll make
the kind of film you want to watch you go and then watch nobody else can judge and nobody can actually add uh
intelligence lies in people who are at the power to use the power misuse the power and then guide the power in a
different direction at the end of the day what do you want to be known for corre I think it also you know there
is something you know which your conscious tell you that is it worth living the life which you have or you
are not that is what determines your own morality correct so I just want to I
want to stop here because there's someone called viewers choice in our comment section who wants to know why you and I are not
in the kitchen actually because intermittent fasting I'm going
to the kitchen I'm going to make myself some breakfast so am I I have a different response for viewer's choice
and it is this because my place is not in the kitchen and our place has not
been in the kitchen for many many years and it is unlikely that we're going to go back to the
kitchen because we are here and we have opinions and just like sandep w who can
make a film like animal I have an I have the ability to make this show sucharita
has the ability to have an opinion on this show and we can put it out on YouTube if you don't like it don't
watch all right so if you don't like our opinion go away it's not don't you to
watch this I Will Survive my channel will survive quite well without I am just I am just from this whole
conversation taking this one thing away Mr Shar just called film critics mothers telling children don't eat chocolate I
am mother I will take it I will be your mother I think I think you know to to
add to um I mean f the question that you asked about thank you for coming I think uh eventually this discourse is
important but we must be allowed to have this discour the the issue with films like this is that they want to uh you
know put a thunderous stop to any discourse that tries to raise a finger against those things you know which is
the problem in itself right have that discourse let us allow all the opinions around this to exist
and engage with those opinions as an artist don't engage with it uh from the
lens of a troll you know if there is something that you find problematic either talk about it and listen about it
and try to come to a place where both of you everybody can actually get to a a common place where you can understand
why this was done but we don't allow for that now if you talk about thank you for coming as a film of course because women
having agency in our country has not happened for a very very in in the world hasn't happened for such a long time
that films that talk about women's agencies are far fewer and far more uh
almost seen as inventive or Innovative you know
versus correct and you know and and films about men with guns have been as
age old as Cinema themselves right so now what is the evolution of those films what that you doing different in a film
about violence that has not been done thousand times before and how are you showcasing a certain kind of
understanding of the world around you when you showcase this violence on screen you know I mean I am not going to
again judge or ask the producer director of a film like that to do what they want to do but as a filmmaker if I'm going to
write something I'm going to ensure that there is a a positive version of a world I want to showcase because there is
enough toxic representations that have already uh uh you know that already out there and as Mr sha said unfortunately
most people are not critically sitting back and looking at the nuances of why this was made of why this was not fair
or whether or not this is an animalistic portrayal or whether whether it is cool if you're going to put a banging
soundtrack when somebody is being murdered they will think that is cool you know in our and you know I mean the irony that I always see when I go to
theaters when there's a smoking scene you know you will have like smoking is injurious to health but when
some you won't have like killing people is injurious to health or you know don't do it that's not something that you know
we we don't endorse as a society that's okay Bloodshed is okay sex is censored
uh but Bloodshed and and murders and misogyny is absolutely okay there is never going to be disclaimer around that
and I feel like we are those disclaimers then and allow us to be those disclaimers you choose to watch whatever film you want but recognize that this
film is not should not be an endorsement of society because if you yeah last
point I say think this is then you should also look at Javan and and patan and also talk how much how feminist
those films are in in which where Shah ruk Khan in both those films almost is
led by you know actresses over there in the first scene in patan where D is introduced shuk is being saved by the
woman and he's completely cool with it he he he's like yeah she's great at what she does why who am I to bother her and
he just allows himself to be saved because he knows that she's great at her job even though you know it doesn't matter what gender shees in the same way
as in in Javan his army is of women and if you're not looking and taking things and if you're not looking at that and
saying that is the society I want to create then don't look at animal and say this is the society I want to create
this is what an alpha is like both films have made Blockbuster openings in fact talking about two films that came out on
the same day on um One S there was um this film there was animal on the same
day Sam bahadur came out which is about a real life sort of hero or
one could argue the real life alpha male you know who sort of talked back to his prime minister an idea that would be
difficult to digest in this moment but you know she was a woman um and that
film netted grossed I think in the first day six CR and this film did 60 and so it's
very clear you know which sort of alpha male uh you know our society is leaning towards right now I'm going to give the
last word to suchar because the the woman should always have the last word
girl Netflix film releas right where Gary Oldman plays Herman movitz the
person who wrote uh citizen King it's a historical about how that film came about and you know why the film is as
important as it is now movie scene where I think he's talking to the editor of the film or the producer of the film and
the person says to M that responsility says in
return I'm paraphrasing
obviously a size of the people on front of the screen responsibity
vulnerable what we are saying what we are doing goes straight to that person and that's what we are responsible
toward people sitting in that dark room it's uh you put your own morality on
reviewing a film you put your own morality while you're watching the film you also put your own morality while you're making the film while you're writing the film we are a free country
we will as much as people are free to make the films that they want to make we are also free to push back as much as we
want to push back and we one must one must always always yeah if if art is not calling
truth to power what is the Point yeah yeah I want to leave it there but you know in closing just to just to wrap
this up for our audience the conversation we first established the fact and I agree with it that um the
director of the film animal is fully within his rights to make whatever film he chooses our laws allow him to do so
uh there is a process in place which involves a sensor board the sensor board is done his job in this case and given it an a rating and said children should
not watch this film it's too violent so that process is also work now within that category it has done really well uh
but there's nothing legally wrong with the film that is made do films influence
young people older people yes they do we tend to especially in India make Heroes
out of um our film actors we tend to sort of copy their hairstyles we tend to copy their dialogues u a lot of people
model their behavior on what they see in those films and so there is a responsibility that comes with being
that popular but it's not a legally enforced responsibility but that film exists in my opinion within a larger
society that also involves schools it also involves teachers it involves parents it involves um you know larger
society different other kinds of content that's available on the Internet or on television and in newspapers and in
books that should collectively also inform this individual along with what they're
seeing on the big screen so while the makers of the film animal are fully
within their right to put out a film that is arguably violent misogynistic
and does so on purpose and also glorifies that violence and misogyny all of the rest of us are also within our
rights to put out statements reviews opinions on that film of what we liked and we didn't like to tell other people
not to see it if we choose to do so to protest in front of the film theater peacefully and say don't watch this film
we think it's too violent everybody is within their rights to do so as long as the violence doesn't become a reality in
the protest or in real life I'm going to leave it there thank you so much for watching enjoy your freedom of speech
enjoy it responsibly
