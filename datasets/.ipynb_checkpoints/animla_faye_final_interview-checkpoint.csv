3.2,195.7,SPEAKER_05,so good evening this is the big debate over having today when a filmmaker makes the film custom take responsibility for influencing young people and for messaging and for the morality result of framework of freedom of speech and expression that we all enjoy in this country should filmmakers be allowed to make whatever no to begin with the censor board or the person who does does a cat   sometimes it's been a lot of criticism about the beautification of misogyny the ideas The Vines young people who changed to relieve me and understand what this means in terms of the impact of youths to begin with she is a food critic and who has been very vocal about films and the portrayal of women. words that mean the language used and this kind of misogyny that gets glorified
197.14,412.37,SPEAKER_02,"is a wetter'n hand of advertising in messaging in our society and I'm really happy that you decided to join us is a with some exceptions understand everything in this room is really allowed within that framework we are here. Society in that space technical deal with on his show stop the jumping off point challenges misogynistic is disrespectful of women high school because he feels his just to send a message disputable speech and expression in a Saturn Street workout partner weather freedom of speech has to mean anything because freedom of speech on what you do not want to hear or what do not want to see popular speech requires no protection you dislike but you still have to allow and hear the framework as far as benzos cancer the censor board looks at whatever aspects under its censorship court and then search for release you cannot require but the censor board also be a sensor of people's moral or messages that go out on foot then you are a second end of the witch supposing the censor board says that you know this is not a proposition that the public should be subjected to or will will accept of public taste so if a filmmaker gets his film certified by the censor board and it has exhibited in accordance with deck there ends the debate you out of Court Street to criticize the phone all all most things, as far as that. Chrissy approach the court saying I find his phone too violent you should not be sure you you possibly challenge the certification by the censor Board of the censor board ignore them alexapure administrative law question that if you set up the law and you do not follow the law then follow the law what is the censor board having applied the law then certifies the full you know it does not a phone with a microphone case on this is not out it should be loved just by giving you one example questions to come up in the Bandit Queen if you remember the film there was a very violent rape for rendezvous was that was integral to the fowling baby stories and you could not have had a dachshund but in fact without that website you know you saw a man's buttocks bare buttocks on the screen possibly. the video showed another where is the director's vision 88's division of I created by the Supreme Court she tried to talk. Video the problem is not the violence the problem is not even the misogyny the problem is not the story the problem"
423.1,474.73,SPEAKER_04,is the problem is the the the the justification of all things does the censor board said that this is a film for violence is a human head open bionics it's fine you know that kind of stuff whoever wants to tell their story tells the story the way they want to tell it and the conversation isn't about whether someone
466.32,466.73,SPEAKER_00,would be allowed to make a certain kind of ammo should not be allowed to make a certain kind of
476.04,504.98,SPEAKER_04,Battlefield makers what kind of films they can or cannot make what this conversation is about is the larger discourse the film and the pushback criticism of the film receives its like that is a status quo that we must adhere to that this is a movie star and these are people making his big butt and face turn on the stream I just take over the shop yes so anyway what does he comes back I can just catch you on talking about animals so yeah it what I was saying to everyone was used in my face is that the question is not about whether the Sunday should be allowed allowed to make this wet weather and it should be acting in such a film The question is
544.51,544.52,SPEAKER_00,biggie is with and organization of the criticism is about what's the film is a propagating what the firm is forgiving of
544.52,544.78,SPEAKER_05,what the film is it in though in the conversation
544.78,544.8,SPEAKER_00,the intention with which you know this story has been as kids
548.68,583.73,SPEAKER_05,most experienced B article machine gun piece off of Bruce Willis's yippee ki-yay g.i. Joe Christmas with a lot of our heads how is that different from this Pops in question to you do you see a problem with animal or are you off the view that he don't like it no I don't have a problem because I'll tell stories
584.85,785.24,SPEAKER_01,"no brainer if you weigh to not include a Twist in the character actually look at the phone with seven liner relationship between his son and the Father which is boring nobody would go to theaters if you actually see the complexity of the characters WWE portraits and that is what makes today's stories story means a biopic to ride today, you just take the complex characters and then you tell it small narrative it's not it's really too small even but you dramatize everything and then the trend of actually no lack of story lack of insight lack of something else in and then hiding behind too much of violence and not too much of a good oenis it's fine you know as the sun Jason don't forget the story and then go get the emotions fine no one morally and legally Legally defined the experts have spoken in illegally nobody can do anything but morally every story writer in the face with a white paper taking rides if they want to write and this is what I'm a member of a keyboard save governance in on leaving creative people who are writing the stories to their imagination and then to their own value systems and then how do you want read the story if you look at it it started with was simple but was able did not have as good as details as it has Ott go to Eunice and I have no problem we're not going to know so that we can but it is just a competition that who I can chop five fingers and then black screen in a can soda fountains River quite perplexed and I when we saw somebody choking what is losing out of diet you you chopping how many streams of blood come out show me used to have your heart completely When We Were Young it over there it is chopped and then licks mint chocolate find you mentally prepared to do that something between princess millions of people and then we think twice what do you want to put and what you don't want it's the messaging that we send out it's what we glorify as acceptable behavior when this person says oh you have the hips to bed and Alpha I know that's why I will marry you or"
804.88,808.38,SPEAKER_05,
804.97,805.58,SPEAKER_00,social point of view why is that problematic in Europe in it didn't want to add to that point
817.5,818.41,SPEAKER_05,anyone should be allowed to make anything that they want right because as I said.
824.47,1007.36,SPEAKER_03,then we are in a file in our country against the things that don't like the movies as so you might have a bomb baby girl which is the series where are you know they've shown a teenager you know experimenting someone filed a case against that and what you say to this right and this is just one case so I don't think that the right way of looking at any film is the to a sensor or to say that you know this guy every film is valid as an expression of the filmmaker that is making and they want to see it is scene in not just the context of what the pin represent but I was in the context of where we are in as a culture very out of the society may I put on it to read recently that said that the difference between a film about a toxic character and a toxic film is the intent of the famico I haven't seen animal Jeremy I don't have but I like Alexa. I don't have the burden of having to watch every film that I can choose not to watch a film I don't think we presented kind of value system that I want to see one street having said that I know that the film filmmaker himself Sunday you know in interviews and spoken about the decided this film is the Mets to make a point this film is made to trigger miss me to be provocative and when you're doing when he showcasing something one screen just to make a point to people who don't and that point is being made to misogyny and that point has been made through excessive Elizabeth point is being made to a certain value system that tries to showcase that there is a certain kind of a man that is cool to watch it's not that the film again you know and and he's he's playing with us because he's called so the fact is that yes it is a film where the person the character in it is supposed to be at the same time the film music Jingle Bell Run music that I can get out of this great soundtrack anytime that there's something problematic that is being shown on screen
1002.59,1002.86,SPEAKER_00,going to a really cool soundtrack which one was put on to say that you must like this this this this woman that you must
1007.63,1062.78,SPEAKER_03,this is Nora animal movement and that they were shocked are baby possum possibly unsurprised that people are clapping when a misogynistic line is being sent or dead clapping when something terrible happens on screen are they laughing at
1038.57,1045.22,SPEAKER_00,and that's the problem with with a film like this it isn't end of the filmmaker it is there it is the lens with which this film is being made and it is done I can do this and and you can just think about because if you do something up if you complain about it that I can point to all the children speak book
1062.86,1099.7,SPEAKER_03,unfortunately
1100.45,1148.26,SPEAKER_05,Zumba Society anywhere this point of time believes that this nation that we're a lot of other gender little men are being told that the big Alpha is actually the right way of being
1148.26,1148.28,SPEAKER_04,beating the women in your life anyway that you possibly can and do you do for a lot of people in the world in India
1148.28,1148.8,SPEAKER_05,should we be making things like this just to make a point just to Showcase that this would trigger a people who want to see a certain kind of a system in the car
1148.8,1168.46,SPEAKER_04,I think that's the issue decorating I used to watch these old Hindi films and someone would die the soundtrack to put in for time to fix that
1164.37,1165.1,SPEAKER_00,the soundtrack informs you that this is something to celebrate we're going back to what he said which is the direction of the film animal
1169.19,1305.71,SPEAKER_04,this is violent after I wish you was a violent film release the next one to be supervisor that was in response to your you where you said that thing was really violent tell us what happened is it is it your fault did you bring the song  dad died of the conversation that's if someone wants to have in the comments section by all means go ahead and have it I would not in my wildest dreams have the freaking lack of self-awareness having said that
1307.12,1355.39,SPEAKER_05,Instagram you should not look at a piece of art to your own morality don't impose your own morality. could be a painting of painting will move you because of what is inside you not just because what is in the in the end up on the canvas touches inside you similarly offend will activate your emotion because of what is already inside you so what I have spoken about the firm is what inside me violence is one thing but what is who is the violence being committed upon and is that with all those acts of violence being justified as heroes or are they to show us the craft of action choreography is not a problem action choreography is great at least Consulting for a filmmaker and to achieve on screen but it's it's the it's the larger picture of it when you look at it as a painting when you take a step back I'm looking at it in a box with a very feminist response because that's just who I am as a person. But you don't it is not about kissing Jessica Nadia how dare he make something like that. How did she say what she said it's about the Cinema is so complex it is such a complex art form because it's called visual audio it's got edited music is called Dance it cuz it's got action to all the other art forms enough enough in one single frame and every second is 24 frames we need to have more conversations around what what it means more critical conversations are required in our country do you get back to subject a subject
1357.31,1390.62,SPEAKER_02,This legal framework also and there is the more responsibility because Bollywood legs what is effectively TV cm to society I'm so when we're making films where it shows a young person walking into a school with a gun is there a disc in your mind you know that we might be encouraging gun violence because we're looking across the world that's the US for example by gun violence in schools of your problem should they be in your opinion of moral responsibility on filmmakers to say is that something I should be doing should I be in Cartagena if we makers not religious leaders I saw each one comes with his own set of morals you make a very violent film and yet the moral of the film could very well be that violence doesn't work do they respond I I think that too is a slippery slope the courts have also at the same time that Bollywood Superstars Windows products Leon on Instagram what is responsible for the quality of it's just be do you mind if I see it I'm just that is a tricky question let me let me put it this way
1406.34,1406.66,SPEAKER_00,when you endorse or influence somebody else's product they are Innocents
1428.21,1592.1,SPEAKER_02,you are taking a certain ownership of it when you are putting your own workout for the play the Jets judge me this is not a message this is my particular version of the of the way that I tell the story I have some support. So for instance write a very very violent book as long as it does not fall within an inside the violence or any of the other prohibited able to Lisa Brooks is film is broke or maybe even a painting he or she does not tell the public that you have to follow it this is a vision that can communicate you won't use your own judgment. I think that's where I join issue with switch on the gay spot are people with all kinds of cases when you you are submitting your heart your point of view to the public say that this is Mike I know that some of you are going to hate it and that's what the director said you may you may hate you may have triggered this is within the law this is my point of view if you like it and you pay to come into the movie theater what does Sim come to the movie theater to think about my duty is to say that vision is possible and that is the vision that can communicate I don't think that what is a father responsibility legally any particular facility a response to that so that everyone has a gay that everyone speak but that gives out as yet because if you are Charlottesville created could be if it doesn't have your gate is then what is it you're not manufacturing it in the factory every song every poem Every limit every film it comes from a human person from a human point of view from from their own lands or Humanity to give us insights about the legality is not that I would debate adult illegal to film again because I was in a few minutes ago
1602.76,1603.35,SPEAKER_04,make us try to express their Creative Vision through their crafts
1630.82,1631.52,SPEAKER_00,Umpqua Bank
1631.69,1700.37,SPEAKER_04,it's like an advertisement isn't it what are actors doing after the marketing the film at the actors are agreeing to be a part of the film actors are agreeing to the message of the film that are there star say that I'm not a big Sports endorsed sugary soda drinks because they are not good for your body and it's not something that he actively we are also endorsing a value proposition after of the values off the the film that they are participants in they cannot be separated from the something since this is someone else's version. Mine can I can I just make one distinction day when a sports person or upon farrago something like that then that is a project with somebody else's made the market all you know about me and then you're endorsing it despite everything often when offense film actor signs of project he starts off with the script is he he's he's a character
1701.64,1758.51,SPEAKER_02,Howard comes out the game that is very kind of control that the actors themselves have responsibility as such it would be more likely to be back of the producer as well as very often as a lawyer I get a brief last minute all the tides look at what is the best possible argument that I can make or what is the best possible performance I can get I am not necessarily endorsing the the character of the plant Snowbird I mean now she for your project and especially the lead male has a tremendous amount of agency
1765.56,1765.83,SPEAKER_00,how do you spell she looks like what she says and what if I'm not mistaken
1777.07,1784.41,SPEAKER_02,is not a new flavored that I don't know how this flavor tastes and tested 
1801.69,1801.94,SPEAKER_00,infantilize the actor understand the character how would the entire story gel together as gabbar Singh
1811.03,1839.96,SPEAKER_04,it was a different person from what organs a was originally slated for the character would have beat Hema Patel what what he has but what he and doors would he have had agency over house
1840.67,1886.54,SPEAKER_02,show me Shelf at two separate endings it was wondering with drink water Monica Bollywood actor get final sign if I'm not mistaken on almost everything especially anyone who wants to box you want to take that yes yes I'm in the comparisons with Glacier difference between actress working in a film versus Arkansas you are and awesome products and and what the product is and if it is legally allowed to be sold in markets where it is not legal issues you sign
1901.83,1904.86,SPEAKER_05,the trouble comes if you don't understand the legalities of it and then you flaunt and then you put something without a thing saying that you are Anderson
1905.92,1942.56,SPEAKER_01,stop people knowing that you as a celebrity paid celebrity in. fall into that misleading people as if you personally are under sink while you are taking money to say the product is good so therefore different companies in film seconds we met and I'm at least two lead actors are too much of the film is going to be treated and nobody takes legality of the right of a director or a writer as good a writer or an actor to express himself freely in that particular
1954.1,1954.12,SPEAKER_00,if it is that a guy who's differently wired and then you are portraying his life and he will because
1964.8,2172.2,SPEAKER_01,where it gets affected is East if they're viewer does not know that is not a normal human being is different so as long as people get to know that what the plot is then they will take the right Maury out of that one the end of the film that has a villain or a hero or what is Ryan Dunn is good or bad the second part legally there is absolutely nothing you cannot ask anybody to stop expressing themselves but it is something called Morality In which you put filters nice creative people we always put that idea in you wanted to make how I do believe you know you can make and then Kennedy 1 to take it to the sexiest level by taking the mail I'll protect you in a second to all the options are available in your head before writing he's correct to your unconscious he don't mean that we do what is right for the brain my own conscience you know what is the kind of story which I want to do tell people and an inference people with my screen so that is where the filter applied by creative people themselves don't nobody can force her info and post them to to to have the filter later or to buy them that is the only thing you know is a creative person many years ago that is now doing the rounds and she's effectively sets that he believes that using either violence or sex extensively in indicates to a lack of talent and creativity complex emotional and cliches and low hanging fruit which will result to in her all the difference in all the stories please don't either hyperbolic or a conflict now what is the conflict which is happening how do I resolve it your intelligence rise in picking the resolution results that is way this entire thing with a UK before you go the closing point is that the law recognizes that it has limitations is within the law you cannot necessarily apply the same moral standard to everyone as long as you do not seek forcibly impose on anybody you know when you click the more I think I think you're usually a lot of people there. Thank you very much for having me thank you
2184.66,2221.79,SPEAKER_02,I just want to I just want to point out the interesting stuff and see what you talked about. video of the football from him in the press conference there's nothing in it what's the message you want to send it so everyone has a film like this is choosing actively to be part of that. responding to the Amazon statement if this is the lowest hanging fruit popsicle to a read the people who are we saying then that the 60
2230.6,2288.23,SPEAKER_05,opening is that the correct number that is probably bigger than that 2nd of August 4th
2287.68,2288.96,SPEAKER_04,"the biggest known Festival, so it's done because of this again"
2289.26,2311.86,SPEAKER_05,I don't know if this is on this year make that statement as relationships relationship absolutely and also I mean I don't want to get my judgment.
2313.12,2323.79,SPEAKER_03,Ascend even ready. But from the ones that I've seen whether it is Kill Bill or whether it is the read you know it wasn't it was both it and it served a purpose that was fully there was an emotion emotion towards to it and you can look at that and say that that is do you know movies about sex sex lies and videotape as an example by suitable is is one of the best during the Independence Center
2323.0,2336.46,SPEAKER_04,all of them have a purpose for existence and again I think in the mind of the director of this film there is a purpose for this and
2336.99,2434.61,SPEAKER_03,people violent yes the context of these people a violent yet and again you know someone mentioned that. I don't know if it was taken in school
2400.3,2400.79,SPEAKER_00,Kevin and Joseph room called the duties which is about school shooting and it showed again these kids going and doing the spiders but there was a justification and a purpose.
2434.63,2543.27,SPEAKER_03,what was my problem again with with friends like this in your eye socket because I wanted to be part of did I have an opinion before I give out but even if Brenda and his character khabib comes into a college and puts his hand on a woman and says you know she's mine and you do to another guy who wants
2547.46,2640.99,SPEAKER_05,"you know and there is a very cool banging soundtrack to it and you know and you know that the point of this is that this is a cool thing to do and who made your kind of try to make everything look like a cool thing because that is the moral stance that you were teaching that's the problem. someone put out a trade that even when things like that had come out of this is after Justified ending he died play some whole time it seemed like it was supposed to be very careful when I do bad guys and which is why when I play bad guys I don't disrespect them because I don't want to look at me and feel like this but most other actors I don't think like this and don't have these moral standards when it comes to them because they're looking for the best part that they can get and the best part of the edible things you know and then you woke the actions they will do it stuff cause I'm being as agency of course  reason to want it is because they genuinely believe that these kind of alpha men are cool and that's what we are having a disc that actually, this is just a movie. station a little further away from the director's responsibility are we now our society and I and I wasn't also I believe that we've gotten to this point in your feels like animals like animals"
2641.98,2836.14,SPEAKER_01,"it's responding to the environment evolved based on the environment the kind of fungus that gets on YouTube the kind of things that get said about women. just things that get about human in the comments section of the man who sits in his car and his. on video is an influence with the huge following the sort of like Jim sort of testosterone need ribbon idea of a man going back to the traditional idea of a man pushing past this is nonsense that you expect us to soften up you expect us to do  is coming from women Israel is this a reflection off that push back in our society right now it is and it is at one point in time to be metrosexual in October to be nice and then to Route 22 healing Golden Brooks and then today men are threatened Mane Attraction at the very basic level how can I see a single women at their bosses dancing women in a behaving Morgan equals casino this phone in the Last 5 Years in on you see the list of films which have made it big from South not in a very very which 5 week long. you look at all these films what is the reflection of the society in our society or you can infer the choice is yours and then today's filmmakers and storytellers choosing the path of the society he's a real estate he's attending based on fact because you're only trying the mirror but you know in this case and they're not showing mirroring the society then actually creating a hyperbolic story you know of one licking aspect of something and then making it a story out of it I mean while we can irrelevant retrospective to a generation but having said all that somewhere for the sake of going to be different and I'm wanting to be personal if people start to think about in a how long is me to continue of this action reality crudite in a row metrosexual almendra alpha male behavior in the society and then killing people in our view if you don't fight because somebody kills his father he's going to go and then King 5,000 people in the movie if you keep a headcount of that so that's fine it's so exciting to take revenge of one killing to 5,000 people isn't killing in line to all this hyperbolic things in which are not really mirroring the society revenge and then you go to some extent to to really make that up and then you struggle and then do that in our 15 mom you know it has a beautiful story line and it does you know it's a fiction but it does create the tension in the store and also the characters has gone a little overboard he's my open and while I'm no judge of anybody somebody else's work I don't like I don't see it but by and large people who create content must be no keep it filter update on spell consciousness in what decorating GTA online content creator alfamidi ideas and is watched by very very young boys and it was said that the young boy who happened to follow him and watch him on the internet oyster Shack is misogynistic ideas and it said that's one of the girls that is very different and is informed by those videos that they which would spend a minute talking about it in the comments section is impact on society "

3093.03,3093.57,SPEAKER_05,I think we were talking and I think the society into a certain kind of
3093.18,3094.0,SPEAKER_04,Alpha behavior in a certain kind of chest thumping you're not angry bully behavior is the easiest thing to do actually you know it's far more difficult and that's fair you know feels like those are tough to make and they get made very less because it's pretty
3102.06,3135.44,SPEAKER_05,"it's difficult to evoke it is far more difficult to evoke a or Humanity from Cinema but it is easier to evoke abrogation. Or anger or irritability or misogyny because the doors are the emotions which are Spitta she don't do the base emotions as much effort and the unfortunate thing is that because most filmmakers 120-b she also make money because this is a Business Journal calling you. But ultimately this, someone and most producers and directors are always looking at the easy way out to make that kind of money versus taking the toughest route"
3141.91,3379.35,SPEAKER_03,"and seeing something that is the truth and again I'm not saying that this is not to leave anger inside you very much must be very much must be and that is also a how to keep things to talk about but I think it's the way if you don't think this one is for the Arts then now are you know what I mean you don't feel like I feel like if you have not studied science and not study, and for did your parents to get into the film industry to get into the media industry to call yourself an artist to write an origin story to put out into the world because I showed one woman slapping another woman now you tell me what what are you going to say to me you know that's a problem I feel like this again I'm not at all saying that we should not be allowed to make this and that he wants to Nick Nick it but I'm saying that you know it's really easy but Nick has like that to point fingers at everybody else and say it or you want to send it but then we talked about the fact that the reason this what the reason it is distasteful according to us is this and not in the context of the character but in the context of what it is you presenting to the side yard light Spigen who is getting too bad when you get offended then your army of supporters than you know Latin to us College memes especially women who has always taken from the start you know I have just been single comment sections it's all just crossed up are you kind of always give you no free pass to people to be like hell this guy acting like an animal for you too as well"
3378.96,3388.82,SPEAKER_04,I'm doing other things that if at any point of time as an example
3387.43,3389.53,SPEAKER_00,I would go out and actually see folks this is just awful this is being made only for entertainment at this is about an animal this is about a character who behaves like an animal
3388.92,3402.95,SPEAKER_04,don't take it seriously don't endorsing the thing that happens in this Sunday I just need it for you and things like that
