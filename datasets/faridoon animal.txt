at least I'll root for him I'll go and Shake do you also find a bit interesting that a few of these um people who who
who tend to have certain opinions they they also struggling actors or maybe directors or maybe they're related to
filmmakers an chra was messaging me constantly that she wants an interview
and she messaged me that doas and after the release like you see
a different color Raj called me after after he criticized my film after I said
that whatever I said in ano's interview he called me and said like Mr W I would
like you to join the round table I said like dude you know you never liked my
filming you hated my film and you hated my guts an Kapoor sir told me that um he thinks ranir Kapoor is tall Raj Kapoor
the way you want me to look in the note scene I think we need 15 days more if you have to Define ranir kapur's
performance in a word or sentence it's not one word there's so many adjectives yeah how much credit will you give to
the screenplay of animal I can't uh dissect and give a percentage but it played a major role best compliment that
you've received for animal so far uh a says
and uh your favorite song of animal there a lot I mean like I equally like all the rashika yti DI the biggest
national crush of India right now rashika is a national crush of India and uh for sure and now I think Kabir saying
your animal film closer to your heart uh
Arjun Mas
Mas Shah Khan in Jaan Shah Khan in patan H
your alltime favorite [Music]
actor hi this is s r Wanga you're watching connect FM Canada with
faridun animal has had an extraordinary response but more importantly um it's a
film made by a courageous director um a director who believes in himself and as
Mr ramar told me recently that uh he is a director who is not afraid to be judged and um it it rarely happens that
a director becomes a superstar and he is being mobbed wherever he goes and it's a huge privilege to have uh um s angari
with us um right now on connect FM Canada uh sandip thank you very much for your time and pleasure having you with
us thank you thank you for having me here thank you for thank you if you can start with what what Mr ropal Varma told
me that here is a filmmaker who's not afraid to be judged yeah do you think that it's one of the finest compliments that you've received yes yes yes yes of
course because uh he always uh uh came to rescue me like a big brother without
even calling him or without even asking for it you know during agility and now during animal so yeah I want to meet him
soon I was traveling a lot so I called him and I said sir I want to meet you and talk to you not on the phone so I'm
going to meet him soon right um massive success for the
film I think almost all of us we knew that it'll be a huge success but um people have seen it like 11 times 12
times and they're going back again um do you do you think that maybe the success of the film um has exceeded your
expectations to be frank uh I didn't aim at the box office while we doing it
because I always felt a story like this to be told and uh just to see the excitement in the audience when this
kind of a story comes into the theater but uh in the throughout the process of the film I guessed this kind of a number
I because uh you even when I was starting to run be and my producers so
but uh it went a little Beyond than my expectations but I I guess somewhere around 6 to 700 but now it is 900 plus
so yeah yeah quite uh excited to see where
it's going to you know end I mean the final number see number is again the
audience you know in the footfalls not money I mean the excitement of seeing the number is seeing the number of
people coming to the theater and watching the film yeah okay how much credit would you give to the screenplay
of the film um the main villain of the film you're not introducing him anywhere till the end you're keeping him for the
last 15 minutes maybe which is something that has baffled many people as well yeah um how how crucial is the
screenplay of this film because I feel it's very very crucial and very important because uh if I wouldn't have
opened the G killing episode like that the way it is now uh it would have been a boring episode because if it is in if
this story is told in a leaner fashion I don't know how much attention I would have you know HED for the entire film
throughout the runtime I feel it it is the it is the backbone the story this
this uh the scenes treatment and the screenplay I think screenplay played a major role and coming to Willen part
Boba because everybody knew now looking at the teaser and the trailer that Bobby
the is a villain and I knew that they going to wait and from the beginning of right after 15
minutes of the film you know there's a tension of the villain in throughout the film but we don't see his face so even
after the interval I could have opened him right after the interval but I thought it is a very routine way to open the villain in
the film so I made the audience wait for almost 28 30 minutes and then I just
introduce like a you know like you know like a face off like a bright we call it you know so so I I always wanted to show
that you know be is in a very uh you know in a very down phase and whereas
will is having fun and getting ready for the third marriage so I wanted to show
the difference and uh yeah it worked the waiting worked actually you see uh
villain after 2 and a half hours of the film and yeah yeah because uh I I always
felt you know because right from the beginning I have this thing in the mind that hero
or you know on the runway so when I imagine that uh image I wanted somebody
Macho who's who's broader than ranir who looks powerful than ran then I thought
like I know nobody else and Bob Ser so yeah right there many many I think
extraordinary sequences if youve talking about the screenplay part of it at the end he's hugging anel Kapoor sir and the
next shot is that he's in the arms of shaki kapor Sab and and uh crying
inconsolably um how do you conceptualize such such such scenes they they've had a
certain impact on people yeah yeah because I wanted to show that you know we have shown throughout the film we
have seen hero reacting to everything which comes in his way and we have shown him like a you know his we have shown we
have picturized him in a very powerful way and he's very strong and taking decs
and you know uh so I thought like in the climax
uh because see the whole point of him doing all this is to secure his father's life and when he comes to know that he's
going to die I think I I
thought like like helpless boy little boy so I thought like that will create a
lot of you know empathy and uh drama for the audience I I I thought audience will
feel bad for him for whatever mistakes whatever things he has done I feel they
have this you know empathy towards it was
and he's holding Mr uncle and crying he's not even holding his wife or his cousins and the way he's holding and
crying and says like Mr Uncle so that that that that made me feel sad when I
was writing also and equally more sad when I was when we were shooting almost
everybody had tears in their eyes while the scene was happening so yeah there there's so many sequences which have
become so huge um many films have been made as far as a father son relationship
is concerned uh Andel sir told me that I think he had requested you to maybe watch M aam and and films like shaki for
example which have had a very strong fatherson um relationships um like a like a sequence
that the way it has become it is it is extraordinary it is
something that that that that that has baffled I think so many people how do you how do you get these these these
ideas in the first place to and maybe to have the vision that it can have the sort of impact that it'll finally have
see the thing is it's a very simple scene actually it's a simple scene of exchanging the roles but you know in the
teaser in the trailer you have seen couple of times father slapping the S and in the narrative also you see ran
saying you know that that is a kind of planting which happened when he when he
retaliates when he uh you know shouts at the father
so and even the even the voice even the the treatment of the scene is like he's
walking and an is just looking at him helpless you know that all adds up to the effect of uh you know when you're
watching as an audience so I feel it's a simple scene but the placement of it you
know it worked a lot and the performances are topnotch you know and
uh yeah and uh and then in the teaser also because in the trailer in the teaser you have seen he's getting
slapped and in the trailer you see son giving uh you know that kind of arrogant
reply and so I thought that that that will work and it worked the way I imagined even in the
trailer and uh because uh because that's the only situation where he can say what
he has to say because he knew he's saying don't worry you know the science
has improved a lot I know so many doctors in us but because it's Advanced stage he knew
that he's going to die so he's just telling to himself that nothing will happen but uh I think subconsciously he
knew that I think that's the reason he thought this is the situation this is the only chance I have now in my life
I'll at least tell him what has what have undergone only about one
day so I thought but rather than uh you know
uh just making a sad scene I thought like see the The Angst is coming because
of love you know because of uh so I thought like it should it should give the audience that uh it's a NeverEnding
angst you know it's not going to settle also so it all helped for me so I was I
I wanted to reach a point in the climax for that I was trying to play around with all these scenes and dialogues and
all that and which eventually everything fell in place yeah you know what what
what fascinates me about you as a filmmaker is that you you're someone who who loves to surprise um usually
concept it's a dangerous situation so usually expected and it's a nice thing
to say
and um it's it's not a s s wer film it is the S Wenger film so you you like to
surprise how how important is it for you to uh not deliver something that that people are expecting and to to be
unpredictable see first thing is the character is like that very unpredictable and top of
it and while telling the story see that you can be unpredictable in the
story see only few times you get a chance and there I I think like we should make full
use of it and knowing her because the
kind of intrinsic details what they share in the relationship only ran Singh will knew about Gali whether she can
really cope up with the relationship with another man maybe he's saying that in in that context or maybe he doesn't
want to see his kids uh seeing their mother with another
the man you know things can be it you know the Reas can be too many but I thought like it's a it's it's a great
romantic line to say like you know suffer in pain but don't get married so yeah so there
are there are many dialogues which are in English um as I told you happiness is
a decision is is is one of the I think coolest lines that I have heard in in in a really long time and there are many
many such lines how how important is it for you to to use the language that you feel
um you want to use instead of worrying about the fact that maybe English
simplify um how important is it for you to follow your own heart when it when it comes to making films because I always
even during Arjun and Kabir and even in animal when when the dialogue is written I always try to say it while typing I
always try to say it now Sor has written the dialogue when we sitting together I always say that dialogue out because I I
I just check whether how how the flow is I I I make sure it is very colloquial
and I feel if I if you have to say it in telu or Hindi happiness is a decision I
think it looks I don't know how it sounds also because it might
sound but you will feel language sing it has to sound very Cal and real
and natural so and English has become part of our life now uh
so happening you
know understood the
context but most of them understood happiness decision simple
words you know it's it's even people who don't who can't
write in English also they understand those lines and it's shorter
also happiness is a decision I me say it or
how you say it in Hindi happiness is a
decision you went into 80s I've never seen never heard maybe
fesa f is a Udu word right yeah it goes into a different Zone till then how he's
talking to the sister SE when you compare like that so I always see like
same thing with the music also when same thing with the dialog Al nothing should pop out so I thought you know that's only
you know Deion making Point yeah so you had you only announced it before
itself that M um I'm not uh going to get toned down because of any sort of
criticism and my next film is going to be more violent and I'll show what what a violent film is all about uh but were
you were were you in a way a bit surprised with the with the sort of criticism that has come from certain quarters I expected this I expected this
criticism it is going to be like multiplied 10 times than because Kabir
Singh criticism was a surprise remember we spoke about this four years back because arj it was like one 12% and
Kabir it was more Kabir was a surprise for me and I understood the way the critics and uh people who were critic
you know criticizing the film uh I understood their point of view and uh it
was I never understood understood I know from where the energy is coming from they only see particular few points
about uh you know in in a film they can't uh criticize or review a film in
totality and uh sorry to say but they don't have any knowledge of the context
why it has been said they don't understand the backstory they only pick few points that has happened in Kabir I
saw that and I very well knew that it will be multiplied like five 10 times and it has happened and still I'm not
bothered because uh it's because they are not doing it in the right fade for
example uh Mr badan also you know reviewed and you
know critique the film he said few points I thought okay you know I didn't feel bad because he was talking about so
many aspects in the film making as I told you last time four years back they only pick on few points even the the
last time when I said in an's interview I was really pissed I was really angry that time you know and uh even it was
not a deliberate uh thing that I wanted to tell because I was almost we're finishing the interview and she said I
hope you know next film will not uh will generate less criticism then I had to say that no no it'll be more because if
you say a love stories a viant film then uh I knew that I'm going to make a violent film and so I said you'll see
what a violent film will be and uh so when you challenge and when you live up to the expectations they'll hate you
more that's what is happening now so yeah right so I was I was watching a
discussion and Mr Sanjay heg he he a lawyer an advocate senior senior
Advocate um so he was basically responding to to a comment about uh gaze
um in um in animal and the morality aspect uh so he said that gays and and
morality basically these are uh they they have no no business as far as uh
what what a filmmaker wants to express himself there's no legal standing first of all in that and it's something which
is very very relative as far as gays and and morality is concerned um do you do you find at times that maybe when when
when a certain people they run out of arguments um they say certain things just to just to be relevant in a
way yeah you see uh because because what what is more fascinating and amusing for
me now is I expected exactly how much they
going to talk about this film and the result is exactly the way I thought way I imagine so in a way I
understood uh uh you know their mental status and their IQ so
yeah and morality and gay is
like no you can't go ahead also in story what
what if the morality comes into picture then you can't make this film
simple
Buton show so and it is clearly said it's a
irated fil film it's over and about 18 years so and people are saying
like girls are feeling insecure high school girls that high school girls are not supposed to go and watch this film
even the boys so uh right in fact ramu s
said one thing that um if um if if if that would have been the case then after
hamon um there should have been more emphasis on on joint families which has not really been the case yeah when we
like that saying you know nobody became gangsters after you know making seeing Shiva or Satya they take it in a very
funny way uh I don't know why only the responsibility Factor comes only
watching the film there's so many things which are in real happening in the society for that
nobody reacts only only for the film they react which is very funny I never understood
this phenomena and what I figured out is like
but he wants to voice out for
example at least I'll root for him I'll go and
sh so you're making money Fame name
criticizing my films then go ahead that's what happened with most of the
critics during Kabir Singh they shot to F by criticizing Kabir sing so now they
are enjoying the yeah do you also find a bit interesting that a few of these um
people who who who tend to have certain opinions they they're also struggling actors or maybe directors or maybe
they're related to filmmakers um do you find that maybe it is a bit unethical for for people um if they are
also pursuing certain the the same field yeah um to just um literally try and
harm the film yeah that's what I mean like how should I how should I put it like you know I don't want to say but since you asked an CH was messaging me
constantly that she wants an interview like I can I have six seven
messages continuously we should meet we should meet we should meet and she messaged
me and after the release like you see a different color so I said like okay I mean what to
do because what I see is like there's a clear hatred towards the filmmaker than
the film which is what actually surprising me and when last time when I
went and sat with her I was uh you know
interview talking about her husband's film that's not the fact because I I am
a fan of VI Chopra because when you see K Arjun RI I use that song you know
that's a song from parinda so you know and uh I didn't say about Sanju
because you know her husband is a producer of the film so but
uh yeah right um but uh when you read a few of the views and and you see certain
videos does it does it upset you see I see Frankly Speaking I if it
is genuinely that's what I'm seeing if it genuinely comes like you feel like you don't need this so much of oil and
somebody says you don't need to shoot 300 people you could have you could have done it in 100 people also then I might
understand maybe sh maybe but when you when you when you
attack the intention of the filmmaker only then it becomes bizarre is because
what what is because what I feel
is Left Right Center you criticize a film in the worst way and after 3 4 days
or maybe a week you call the filmmaker and call him for the round
table I said like why you want me to sit at your show you never believed in my
fil and my vision see for examp example uh for example uh rajim Mas called me
after after he criticized my film after I said that whatever I said in ano's
interview he called me and said like Mr W I would like you to join the round table I said like dude you never you
never liked my film you hated my film and you hated my guts you criticized it so badly and if I come and say what are
you going to talk I said like you know your relationship ship like people who
criticize my films at this level for them the relationship between me and you
is from the screen to the seat you go and watch my next film and do another
video and I'll react another video but I'm not going to commence it in your show
so how this things how they at what level they operate yeah so but I figured
out that he gave up uh you know reviewing and critizing films now so
yeah right so uh s there a senior trade analyst um mentioned in his reviews that
at least 100 crores will be added to the film's collections because of uh the way the film is being
criticized um I also uh heard a few statements in the sense that that sandep
sandep knows that what is it that is going to um um just get the audience
into into into theaters and maybe because of that he's he's putting these scenes um I've I've known you for quite
some some time and U I personally have have I I find you to be extremely I think simple person um and I don't think
you you're that calculative maybe to to just uh put certain scenes so that that that can possibly be bringing to the
theaters you're in a way U just going away from the from the family audience you're you're using English at at many
times maybe I don't think that um getting the audience at any cost is something that that you're you're really
looking at do you find it a bit disrespectful when when a filmmaker's intentions are doubted the number is
multiplied
now I don't think so I ever do that ever in my life in future maybe you know they
felt you know that the last guest what the old rir Kapur does they thought it
was giving it back to the critics because an chobra herself felt that you know was doing to the critics but my
intention was not that you know I thought like I'll just end the film with attitude because I want audience to
think and root for part two I mean animal park so that's the intention but
they took it in another way because the moment he does the guess the next the next shot is my name comes on screen so
they thought I was just giving back to them I don't do that yeah right okay now the interesting part
is that um someone in Dallas a girl in Dallas she told me that if you uh if you
interview sandep so please just tell him um that why is it that people are not talking about uh the sequence of K when
rashmika gives it back to to ranir and he just listens um and it's a very strong I think rashmika has been
presented very very strongly as well um so do you as as you as you mentioned in the in the beginning as well that
selectively certain things are picked up yeah and certain things they're not not said and maybe I think the film should
be looked in entirety in in a proper context yeah because it is out of their capacity trust me I'm telling you
because I've seen reviewing other films also the way they talk I feel like all these guys they should go to China to
you know in China you know what's the most happening thing in China the English tution they're good with English
so they should go and tutor in English because other than that every time you see their reviews you find new English
words other than you don't find anything else because even Kabir also they did that they were very selective in Kabir
slapped they never spoke about PR slap back pry was the first person to slap and never never they never said about
that I don't know how that you know even to even today in an animal they say uh
the hero of the film made the girl to lick his
shoe and it's a torure for three and a half hours if you want to go go watch
but I would suggest you not to go how can you say that such a shame seriously such a shameful thing to say that you
know how can you do that why you are saying to the audience because nobody cares that but still there will be few
people that think like okay let's not watch this film and this negative thing
is not going to help it is going to hamper the film for
sure negative you think because
ofaj and that fgy girl opening it's because the craft
nobody speaks about the craft nobody speaks about editing sound design nothing because they're they're literally illiterate and uneducated when
it comes to films they are like they have no sense of you know to criticize a film or a review a film they only see
the sensitive part of it and they speak and then down D and like this is what to say like you know then and if
at all you want to sit with them and talk face to face also they don't have the guts to do that they beat her on the
bush and talk some nonsense and the show is over so yeah so I think I've drifted from
your question was I answering the right answer to your your question I think no it's fine it's fine
it's absolutely fine you know what what what is interesting that um there are there are there are some people who are
talking about the film and they've not seen the film exactly exactly last time I'll tell you one thing you find it
irresponsible if you've not seen the fil very responsible during Kabir Singh I'll tell you after after you interviewed me
that that next day because that time the this fully uh Bombay was packed with water I mean there's fully rains if you
remember I was supposed to go back to Hyderabad because this the the flight were not functioning so I was stuck in
Bombay then I got a call from NDTV saying that you need to come and sit in the panel so I said like okay
I'll come so I sat in the car I was going they're calling me are you coming are you late then I said yeah I'm coming and then I asked who are who are the
people who are there so that I know then they mentioned a few names and I asked
them
as but at least know what the
f but they're sitting and talking a lot they spoke for one one and half far in
the prime time and entertaining and they were showing my pictures in the background you know
crime a director speaks like that see the audacity of the director and all the nonsense it was and what what I said in
an show is I said it's like it's a context I'm saying like if you know if
you don't have the sincerity in expressing yourself that's the whole point and I said it's applies with both
but the only point but second time when I said I didn't say V versa so they used it very
selectively and I quoted it like as though you know I said something very uh you know it's so stupid I'm I'm not
uh feeling bad but I'm feeling like how how can they do this like like what what
is this I never understood and uh they have I mean what now one thing I understood now 5 years
almost 5 years in Bombay there's a gang there's a gang they only like one
particular kind of films they praise that particular filmmaker film and other filmmakers films are done to death I
mean and uh during Arjun radi also you know there is a culture of giving money to the critics and reviewers or whatever
you know I never did that I never did that I never do that yeah I never you if
you notice in my entire life in my three films I never tweeted or you know pasted
the review on my Facebook wall or insta or Twitter I never do that the first
time I did was rgbs because I respect that man and I'm a big fan of his work and I truly believe how much he has
contributed for Indian Cinema nobody has done that
and but I never do that so maybe you know I I'm not in the good
books of them that's why they talk nonsense but they don't they don't even try to
analyze the film they only talk about two three things man such a illiterate people these people are
so what I figured out is after animal now I I know that this is going to be there till how many other films I make
they going to be
there which I mean I don't even they dare to criticize animal park
so I'm not saying that now I'll do it more because the content is like that yeah okay and and something about your
association with with buhan G um you guys are doing more films together um um
how important is to have a courageous producer backing you up because more than courageous producer obviously is a
gutsy producer but majorly uh my my brother is also part of the you know
this thing so I don't have any interference and I don't have come
somebody coming and telling me why you going there how many days are going to shoot or or what is this music or why
you are taking that particular actor nothing I'm having the Comfort the way I
shot Arjun R when my brother produced the same thing it's a lot more money inv
world but other than that it's it's trust and comfort and understanding so
what else you want you know like so I thought so that's the reason like we doing multile know extraordinary
music score I think every I think Arjun Wy is is one of the I think it's one of one of the fin songs
that I've heard in the longest period of time and the way it has been picted I think it is Artistic the way it's
extraordinary I think it's totally totally amazing um and using an Iranian song for for Bob's
Anthem I'm sure that you must have curated that even Arjun Valle um Manan told me that how how you guys
collaborated together uh other other songs as well I think you have you have an amazing sense for for for for romance
as well um background score too is is is outstanding how crucial is music for you
see as I told one of the interviews also that I I can't imagine without atmosph sound or a Foy or a s sound effect or a
music something has to be there for me to figure out what I'm writing I think
that is the reason for me it takes time for me to finish a script cuz I can't go ahead if I don't know what kind of music
I'm playing because when the a fight is happening I knew the cousins were standing back I wanted a song
and lip sying song so I wanted a song full rageful
Courageous song that two because guys are from pen I wanted in Punjabi and I
know this film is made in other languages also now so I was thinking when there's a lip sying I can't dub
into T I was searching for a old folk song
and uh we found bubble's song in the YouTube YouTube it had 315 views can you
believe 315 views and it is there on the YouTube from past 5 years same song Same
tune and manes took it another level using beats and abusing piano in between
and all that but the tune and the lyric is there from 5 years nobody noticed the
song i s like what a gem of a song this is then finally I said that I need this
song and we got hold of the man was somewhere in uh Canada she que back to
chandigar I met him in Delhi he came to Delhi from chandigar I told him sir I
Need Your Song and all that so he graciously removed from the YouTube and
uh we added some music and that's it even even the uh Iranian song also
whenever I I write a story I I I I I I have a fold up for everything like Arjun
Ron material animal mood material Spirit mood material I collect some kind of a
mood material for me because it's you need to be self motivated on your own
story your your story should give you the kick from the day one till the release of the film through the process
of this two years or 3 years or four years whatever time you are in the film in the story that has to motivate you so
that you are pursuing the making of the film so for that you do great visuals
you need uh you have to think about who is playing this character collect the actors photographs so I do a lot of
research on that so I I found this music somewhere on the YouTube uh Iranian song the moment I got
the song I just thought this is a song for the introducing a villain I don't
know why I felt the moment I heard I I was I just imagine Bobby
so and suddenly one day I visited in the between the shoot then I was figuring
out what was that song then I forgot song then I open my laptop then I saw it coll up somewhere it is there
then I removed it then uh while shooting also we were playing on the speaker
then we have modified little to you know to the sound was a little low because
it's a YouTube quality so we update little up so that's how that song came
and uh even the marati song I was uh I
was uh going to Goa from Bombay we were we were driving from Bombay to Goa and
shapur poni uh radio play I was playing radio in the car so songing when we were
driving so that caught my attention it has some kind of a tune some kind of a
beat which was I The Moment I Saw even same thing like it's a first instinct with music I thought like
action and I always imagin Freddy character as a mar character I don't know why I imagine a marati character so
this is a marati song it's going well with it so I figured out it's A's music and some music company I think Z has it
and Son Z and we got the permission and we used it and even the starting Roa
theme in Arjun RI audio function the Tori band was playing some music when
the crowd is coming and sitting filling the auditorium so I I I saw I looked at
them they they they too good with the work so I remember they played some
rahman's tracks I said like great I mean like ma as one kid I
said then I I saw another music of them in the YouTube then I call them so they
I know them D since ENT ready time so I said like dude you know you come and you also act in the scene and I want to use
that piece because in that when rir comes and dances in the first scene
trior band was actually playing uh the music the chin chin Asha so like that
like for even for Arjun also I had few ideas about how the music has to be so
maybe I was I'm very particular about what music I want to use in particular scenes so that's why it is very uh yeah
hard hting yeah no absolutely uh because and you know the best part is many of times in films certain sort of music is
used certain sort of dialogues are used to cater to certain cultures and and and and regions so that uh you can you can
get certain amount of audience from that particular region but knowing you and and the and the honesty that you
have I'm I'm I'm very sure about the fact that that you are more um Criterion
for for selection is that you like something rather than thinking marati audience
audience I don't think having known you for some time that and that honesty is something that is is is is beautiful as
far as you're concerned Arjun Valley if we're talking about the picturization
that's the first communication the the ax communication was the first communication of animal that came out of
ranir yes yes and the pr and that was very very powerful yes very powerful so
how did you how did you conceptualize that entire sequence because song is one part of it but the entire entire entire
mood the way it has been captured I feel it it's an it's it's an artistic stick piece in itself yeah because see see I
wanted I wanted it to be a heavy Action episode in the interval because I want I wanted the hero to be uh wounded and you
know pissed with bullets and ax mans so for that to happen I thought like it has to have some particular length and
uh Supreme suar Master composed the entire fight so I I told him like we'll
dissect like wave one wave two wave three and way one was a marati song and
there's a break where they're doing the first a and suddenly you see these people come with the skull caps so I
thought there's there's a dialogue there's a little little kind of a scene in between there's a break there's a music I thought that 18 19 minutes will
be fully you know audience I I I was very sure that I can hook the audience
without getting bored and uh that's what happened I mean that's purely a uh what is required for the film and it's one
it's I think one 47 minutes first half and so many of them said
that I think that's that's the biggest compliment I mean they did they did find
the ab time and when it is 3 hour 21 minutes you know
like you know you are doing the film with a kind of Madness but don't imagine it's three including the news real and
all that AK Kumar's s and everything it's 3:23 the r time is 3:23 so yeah right anel
kapor sir told me that um he thinks ranir Kapoor is tall Raj Kapoor um how do you look at his his his
Devotion to his Craft um he can put on weight he can lose weight he can look like a teenager he can look like a
40-year-old um he can he can he can uh he can grow here he can he can just cut
cut here um he can do um um love making scenes U without any any inhibitions
without uh the fear of being judged um he can he can mouth dialogues um
believing in in the vision of his director and not worrying about how he can possibly be judged um how do you
look at this this particular devotion um of an actor I feel his his focus and
attention is at another level is a very effort and and I
II is doing a lot of processing to get into the character I felt that process
was very effortless and uh even the transformation was very
effortless so he was very keen sometimes you know you know he said like S I need
another 15 days the way you want me to look in the note scene I think we need 15 days more so he was very particular
in everything he's like a you know uh to to simplify it you
know passion interest F and I think that's the only
answer and the one best quality is like he'll never Jed you saying I don't think
so this scene should be like this or this D should be written that way he'll never you'll never hear
say I don't think so it's always I understood that it's always whenever I
said anything to him uh he'll think why he's saying
that why sandip is saying this and why SS
balir should say this dialogue he was always with the character he was not judging the film or the character or the
dialogue from an outside perspective Ang
perspective so he's always into the character with the film with the filmmaker I think that the reason this
film is possible if if a Personal Agenda of actor comes into
picture and uh when I narrated a line like 10
minutes 15 minutes after 78 months I narrated like three and a half hour story so when I
narrated the line when he said yes unknowingly when I was sitting on the treatment and the scenes it has the
story I was just writing for him uh more than uh
without Imagining the face of the actor I didn't write because I know that he's doing the film so if you don't want if
you want to stop the process also he'll come into your mind because you know that he's going to do it eventually so that's a very different process which
has happened for this film yeah because when I was writing arju I didn't know that VI will do okay now uh ramu told me
that in the last 110 years of of Indian Cinema since Raja Harish Chandra he's not seen uh such an amazing performance
the way be kapor has uh inhibitionless performance and extraordinary performance um do you do you do you
conquer with them how do you how do you respond to because I think it's a huge statement to make
yeah I want to believe that uh but but since it's my film if I say that
you know you'll feel but I genuinely feel uh that every
every frame every bit every scene every shot he was in the character he didn't
drift at all I didn't see uh he was away from the character right from the school
scene when he is holding the rifle and going into the classroom from that scene till the Old Man scene he was with the
character even the way he played the butcher even that was very uh
outstanding the way the way he didn't take much time also to transform it's like we we I spoke to him I I thought
like R I think we should have this kind of hairstyle we should have a little denture and we'll have a we'll have a
spotshot you know skin will be like little pinky skin about discuss Kia and
look test Kia and next day we were on the set simple and the way he was walking also
like you know when you have the sh with the knives when he's walking you will not guess that and the way he was
walking you know the walking style is completely different so so he just got into it just like that within two
days discuss shooting it's like that yeah how
do you look at the performance of of of rash Maka see well you know what I figured out is when she was dubbing in
telu uh in Canada I figured out some she's more comfortable in Hindi now and
I thought while we were shooting she'll take a lot of time to get the lines but
uh she got it uh she just got it like that when we're changing the lines also on set sometimes
I change lines on on set so and um I think
uh I strongly believe that she understood ganali
character because the way she was emoting she was she behaved like
literally like a wife who was you know in support with the Alpha Man knowing
him from the school days that was very much tangible and visible that's what I felt when I was making the
film I don't know even I I didn't ask her how did you prepare and all but I
strongly believe that she believed in Ran sing balir not as a character as
rashmika Mand also I felt she understood R sing balir that's the reason I thought
like the performance was really good
because any actor when they perform
a little of their character and little of the character which the writer director
writes so when I think like that yeah she she got it
right you know South Indian
actor uh the the you know they very good
together I mean the units of fish pairing you know yeah no I think it also
stems from the director as well because I think the way you have um handled the entire Punjabi element uh in in in the
film is is something it is so seamless because many times uh there tends to be that this entire um I think situation
where this maybe the South Indians may may not understand the nuances of of say North Indians or say punjabis but here
it is spot on it is very very seamless which is which is brilliant um tripti di
um came as a complete surprise has become the latest national Crush how do you respond to trp's extraordinary
response yeahp because see see we wantedly didn't use the song in the
promotion what uh trailer maybe we just used for one shot so in the story also
she'll come at a point where nobody expects another new character to come there's another new Love Story which
which almost we reaching the climax so this there are little odd facts that
also helped the entry of the character and uh she was uh also a very uh you know um
very spontaneous uh actor for example if she has prepared some for for some ex
emotion and if you come in change right away in front of the C camera in between the takes said I don't want this I want
completely diagonally opposite of what you're doing and she would shift like that that that she did it like a pro I
mean that that quality actually was you know which I never thought I thought like now we both work Ley I mean like we
have to shoot a longer period but it just happened like that so things like that really uh you know help the
character also and uh we could uh complete the shoot on time also and it's it's a lengthy dialogue when when she
confuses you know in the pre-climax to or that you know she's a so that's a
long dialogue and most of the time I short on a single short I was changing the uh frame and length and I was always
taking the entire R in a single shot and I was shifting in the edit but
when when I was shooting I wanted in in one flow because it will help the edit when you shi to other shot also because
it's a lot of emotion she's crying and emoting so that was that was
brilliant yeah right and um lots and lots of I think um expectations from
Animal Park U if it releases tomorrow it'll become like a bigger hit that maybe animal too many too many questions
when are you starting Animal Park I'll start after I finish uh spirit so yeah we want I thought like
it's better to give that kind of Gap and uh probably I'll start in uh uh end of
26 or uh middle of 26 and we'll see yeah
2026 you're also having a film with ALU Arjun I believe yeah but the uh nothing is
concrete as of now but we mutually very much interested in working with each other so yeah that's there but it it
will take time little time yeah yeah [Music]
yeah we'll quickly end this interview with a short rapid fire please okay
animal in a hashtag for you hashtag anything for father okay um if you have to Define ranir Kapoor's performance in
a word or sentence outstanding [Music] mindblowing superb brilliant it not one
word there's so many adjectives yeah and I'm a fan
yeah right how much credit will you give to the screenplay of animal screenplay treatment uh you know I I can't dissect
and give a percentage but it played a major role it it really played a major role n regular linear screen yeah best
compliment that you've received for animal so far uh and
uh uh heik s messaged and mahes b s spoke on phone R sir everything was best
I'm not trying to be Diplomat because all of them said different things in anujin and even
ramcharan chj s they all they all spoke a lot about the film so yeah right your
favorite song of animal uh arent really and
P and the climax B there lot I mean like like all the
three songs and papa Maran yeah okay if you have to choose between
either or or two options Arjun your personal favorite
arjuni papan papan okay rashmika y di the biggest
national crush of India right now oh see rashmika is a national CL of
India and uh for sure and now I think know uh she's on the rise of the
popularity dpy so yeah I'm happy for both of them
kapap which is more attractive uhab Kabir saying your animal film
closer to your heart uh Arjun
ready Masala do CH uh ch masal
ranir kapor the younger younger ranir Kapoor or the the the middle-age ranir
kapor both man even the old man all versions of ranir Kap
there right Shah ruk Khan in Jawan Shah ruk Khan in patan ah Shah ruk Khan in
Jawan yeah it is so interesting that in in my interview four years back you said
that you would want to see Shah ruk Khan in an action mode the way he was in Ram Jan and and earlier films and when when
patan and Javan they became a success that that clip was shared a lot people would love to see you working with yes
yeah I would love to I would love to I I have uh if I get a chance uh I think
it'll be great I'll definitely do I don't know when but uh yeah what is your
all-time favorite film well there are a lot of films uh maybe uh one flu or cuu
List Shang Redemption and there are lot of films in Tel but you would
your alltime favorite actor all right your all-time favorite
actress uh I'm
M great uh true or false following statements screenplay is the backbone of any film yes film critics are irrelevant
yes relevant see Irrelevant in terms of in terms of what in terms of success or
in terms of how a filmmaker will take it depends the question it depends for the success of the film uh if if it is
average if it is a small film which is coming with a limited expectation and the critics can kill the film and it is
animal they couldn't touch it you know it depends on what the size of the film was the expectation of the film also so
you have to be very specific when you ask this question so yeah
I was stressed by the negative criticism of animal I was not stressed at all but I was uh irritated by seeing they're
talking only on again A exibit A and exibit B and that's it the same thing no
change to um respect from audience is everything respect for from audience is
you know sincerely coming to the theater not about the money the time because I I
noticed uh we had shows in Bombay at 2:00 in the night so Monday morning
he'll go home at 6:00 that never happened for any of the film I heard so that was brilliant for
few days 24 into 7 the shows were running 6:00 show 7:30 there were shows
which I never heard in Bombay I used to see that in South a lot
but I feel superb about it yeah now this
there was there was a five 30 a.m. show as well 1:00 a.m. 2: a.m. and then 5:30
a.m. shows okay I'm I'm misunderstood but I don't have to clarify myself to anyone uh I feel I want to but now I
feel like uh you know they're deaf so there's no
point I don't think so I have to CL because that I figured out now during
Kabir sing I used to feel that I have to explain them but then now it's pointless Prime aim of Cinema is entertainment
yes a BCD but a is entertainment and slash
entertainment make sure you don't bore the audience that's that's PR don't bore the
be fact you say anything yeah say anything on screen but never bore the
audience screen but it is boring then there's no point if you can't hold the audience attention it's useless then
that that's what I believe amazing uh sandip thank you very much for your time it was like amazing talking to you um
congratulations for the success of um of animal uh your birthday I believe is coming up it's on 25th December yes yes
yes yeah so happy birthday to you in advance thank you so much and thank you so much for having me here and uh as
